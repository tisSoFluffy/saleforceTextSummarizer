“You are caller number 10; please stay on the line.” A few years ago, a phone message like this from a company was a standard part of the customer experience. 
But today, customers expect more. They expect callback options. They expect to open a chat window on your website, or send a text message or a Tweet, and get a near-instant reply. They expect that you already know who they are when they call, that you’re aware of their most recent order, and that you understand what they need next. They don’t want to repeat their information. And they definitely don’t want to wait.
For customer experience in 2019, this is the new normal. Twenty-five years since the popularization of the internet and 12 years after the introduction of the iPhone, customer expectations keep soaring. Customers don’t just want the right product at the right price — they want the full package. In fact, 84% of customers say the experience a company provides is as important as its products and services.

As products become less distinguishable by brand and price, providing a great customer experience has become essential for companies to differentiate themselves. Here are some ideas and strategies for doing just that.

Understanding customer experience

“Customer experience” gets thrown around a lot, but how’s it actually defined?

“Customer experience and service have converged,” said Peter Schwartz, Salesforce Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning. “It’s more than call centers and successful responses to problems; it is service opportunities in sales, support, and marketing. Delivering great customer experiences now means providing amazing almost magical service at every opportunity.”

For example, think back to the last time you called your cable company, filed an insurance claim, or booked a vacation. When you were done, how did it feel? Was the overall experience easy and enjoyable — or headache-inducing? What did you think of the company that provided the experience?

We’re not just talking about the customer service you received — the customer experience is broader and deeper than that. What’s important is the total perception of the company, interaction by interaction, from the first touchpoint to the last. This may include navigating the website, talking to sales reps over the phone, visiting a store, sampling a product or service, and experiencing an onboarding phase after a purchase.

The point is that at every one of these moments, customers form judgements about whether a company is living up to their expectations, and making it easy and enjoyable for them to do business with. In other words, customer experience is the sum of all these interactions.

Why is customer experience important?

Customers have always wanted a consistently good buying experience and the best value they can get — but the stakes are higher these days. Technological advances (i.e., the Fourth Industrial Revolution) have led to disruption across every industry. This has given customers greater choice and greater freedom to take their business elsewhere if they’re not receiving the experience they expect. Not happy buying expensive razor blades? Why not sign up for an inexpensive monthly subscription and have them delivered to your door? Fed up with mediocre hotel chains that don’t offer value for money? Why not try AirBnB?

The rise of social media and review websites such as Tripadvisor and Yelp also give consumers more of a voice than ever before if a company provides a poor experience. Whereas consumers might have shared a bad experience with friends and family in the past, social media means they can amplify experiences — for better or worse — to a much wider audience. 

Together, these factors have given consumers an upper hand in their dealings with companies.

Customer experience isn’t a new concept, but it’s never been more relevant. Our research shows that salespeople — once overwhelmingly focused on closing transactions — now track customer satisfaction more than any other metric. Nearly half of marketers — once mainly concerned with driving new leads — now champion customer experience initiatives across their entire companies.

The reason? A large majority of customers (84% per new research) believe the experience a company provides is as important as its products and services. Providing service with a smile isn’t enough. The same report shows that 73% of customers expect companies to understand their needs and expectations.

At the same time, a standout experience with one company is also prompting 73% of customers to hold other companies to higher standards. The Amazons and AirBnbs of the world are changing customer definitions of “good customer experience” in a way that transcends industry.

The good news? Great experiences reap great rewards, with 66% of customers now willing to pay a premium for them. This means that businesses have an opportunity to increase revenue by delighting their customers in a way that no one else can.

What makes a bad customer experience?

Customers think many companies haven’t caught up with their new standards. Only 51% of customers say companies understand their needs and expectations. And even fewer (47%) believe companies adapt to their actions and behavior.

Just as with friendships, customer relationships bloom when individuals feel understood. If a friend ignores a call, text, or email, it probably doesn’t bode well for the overall relationship. Likewise, relationships can weaken when customers feel that businesses don’t appreciate their personal preferences, whether that’s remembering they enjoy romantic comedies, or that they would rather be contacted by email than by phone.

A lack of trust can also derail a customer’s experience before it even gets started. While customer data is an essential part of delivering personalized experiences, customers need to know that if they choose to hand their data over, it will be safe, and used legitimately, in a manner that’s beneficial to them.

As questionable business practices make headlines, customers are growing ever more selective about the brands they trust. In fact, 54% of customers say it’s harder than ever for a company to earn their trust. And this has a real and lasting business impact; 65% of customers have stopped buying from companies that did something they find untrustworthy.

Businesses that clearly articulate how they use their customers’ data can gain and keep their trust. Seventy-eight percent of customers are more loyal to companies that are transparent about how they use customer data.

A company’s trustworthiness also represents something bigger: its values. Increasingly, customers are considering what a company stands for when deciding whether or not to buy from them. The same study found that 77% of customers said an increased awareness of corporate values, ethics, and business practices was changing their expectations as customers.

What does a great customer experience look like?

One challenge for companies trying to get this right is that customer expectations keep soaring. Increasingly, customers want experiences that are connected, memorable, and differentiated. We’ll talk through examples of each.

Connected customer experience

Our research shows that more than two-thirds (69%) of customers expect a connected experience when they engage with a company. This means that their preferences are known across touchpoints and interactions, and any required information can be quickly accessed. For example, in a customer’s mind, a service agent should know the details of any recent ecommerce transaction they made, and engage accordingly. Salesforce found 78% of customers now expect these kinds of consistent interactions across departments.

U.S. Bank recently took the step of connecting all of its employees with a single, unified database of customer information. The solution also allows the bank to turn raw data into high-value insights, which can be used to drive decision-making, and personalize its financial offerings for customers. 

Customer relationships had previously been built within individual business units such as banking, mortgages, investments and payments, even though customers often dealt with multiple business units. This led to disjointed and often unsatisfactory customer experience. By approaching customer relationships as a single business, employees now have an aligned and complete view of their customers’ interactions with the entire company. This allows them to create a unified customer experience across all business lines and strengthen relationships with customers. 

In turn, customers now have an easier time accessing financial services across all channels, including mobile devices, personal computers, ATMs and 3,000 branches across 25 states.

Memorable customer experience

It’s not enough for businesses to provide personalized customer experience, they need to do it in a way that helps them stand out from all the other companies trying to do the same thing.

European brand Brunello Cucinelli creates high-end clothing for men and women. However, in the age of the digital shopper, the brand found maintaining its personal touch challenging. It needed to find a way to bring the personalized experiences it was known for in its stores to its online outlets as well.

The company’s solution was to implement what its leaders have dubbed “graceful technology” — a centralized system that enables it to build stronger, more personal relationships with customers. Featuring easily accessible customer order histories and automated workflows, the system is helping store managers to expedite online customer service needs. This in turn enables employees to spend more time building relationships with shoppers. Customers can also receive in-store service regardless of where they connect.

Since adopting its new solution, the business has quadrupled ecommerce revenues. Brunello Cucinelli has successfully translated the luxury experience to the digital realm — and in the process, set new customer experience standards for the mass market.

Differentiated customer experience

Customers want businesses to treat them like the individuals they are and receive tailored engagement, based on their unique needs. While niche brands were the first to offer differentiated customer experiences, this is now the expectation people have of mass-market companies as well.

Take Piedmont Healthcare for example. With the U.S. healthcare industry shifting to a “value-based” model, the healthcare provider was under pressure to improve patient outcomes meet growing patient expectations and by offering more personalized medicine. To do this, Piedmont Healthcare realized it needed to embrace technology to help it engage with patients and assist them to get easier access to care, by personalizing how the company connects with them.

The organization’s solution was to implement an integrated cloud-based system to capture patients’ information and create comprehensive patient profiles.

Piedmont Healthcare’s solution also gives the company better insights into its relationships with both patients and physicians. This enables them to use data-driven insights to create high-quality, personalized marketing communications for both groups. Sales staff can also use the system to deliver personalized messages to physicians at scale, track engagement, nurture leads and follow up with greater speed.

What’s the future of customer experience?

With success stories such as these making the market acutely aware of what’s possible, 75% of customers now expect companies to use new technologies to create better experiences. Peter Schwartz believes businesses will eventually use AI to achieve a step change in customer experience, turning a “comprehensive trove of data into insights that can anticipate customers’ needs and act as their digital assistant.

He uses the example of a frequent business traveler who walks into a hotel room to be greeted by her favorite song playing, photos of her family in digital frames, and an email in her inbox asking if she wants the Caesar salad, without croutons, she ordered from room service last time. The temperature and lighting are set to her preferred levels, and when she turns on the television, it suggests a movie she’s yet to see, starring her favorite actress. A rental car of the model she’s considering buying is available at the hotel.

“This isn’t marketing to a category of consumers,” Schwartz says. “It’s applying AI and all the customer data to cater to the needs of a single individual, which is much more powerful.

Glen Hartman, Senior Managing Director, Digital Transformation, for Accenture Interactive, has also described the potential for unprecedented levels of customer immersion. “Say you usually do your grocery shopping on a Saturday morning. You use the store’s app, you belong to its loyalty program, and perhaps you’ve even attended a do-it-yourself cooking class there. So, they know you well,” he says.

“When you walk in the door, the store knows you’re there through location technology. They can see the shopping list you created using its app. Delivering a real-time personalized experience in this context could mean the store saying, ‘Listen, we notice you’re shopping for these three ingredients. If you added these other things, you could make this recipe.’

“They could even show you a video of what the recipe looks like, right on your phone. Then they might upsell you on some other things to have a great dinner that night. So, you stay longer in the store and add to your shopping cart, and the store says, ‘That’s a successful shopping trip.’”

Hartman stresses that people also expect the brands they love to understand their wants and needs in context — otherwise, it’s easy to miss the point and end up alienating customers. As he points out, if that same customer came back with the goal of quickly picking up some medicine for a sick child, for instance, and was offered all kinds of coupons and additional ingredient suggestions, their experience would clearly be less than optimal.

How can companies improve customer experience?

There are shelves of books devoted to answering this question. However, the advice can be distilled down to two pieces of advice.

Instill a customer-focused mindset in your employees. Putting the customer at the heart of your business — from marketing to point-of-sale procedures and after-sales follow-ups — needs to start with senior management using their leadership to drive “customer obsession” from the top down. Make customer obsession principles part of executive conversations and business planning — during pipeline reviews, inside shareholder meetings, and throughout the business development process. Encourage teams to adopt an “outside-in” approach, where people put themselves in their customer’s shoes. Ask what their needs are, what’s driving their decision-making, what their goals are, and what they’re feeling.
Consider getting started with AI. As we’ve described above, implementing AI represents a sea change in the kind of customer experience your company can deliver. As a starting-point, get clear on the specific business question you want AI to answer. Once you’ve defined specific use cases for AI, consider how existing workflows would be impacted and who would need to be reskilled.

The use of AI in customer service may be nascent, with just under one-quarter (24%) of service teams using it today. However, the fact that 62% of customers are open to companies using AI to improve the experience they receive signals a growing role for use cases such as chatbots, text and voice analytics, and more. In fact, AI adoption by service teams is forecast to surge by 143% over the next 18 months.

Remember that today’s connected customers are more knowledgeable, are keenly aware of the high levels of service that new technology enables, and have limited patience for brands that can’t keep up with evolving standards. Delivering outstanding experiences today isn’t a luxury – it’s the expectation. Aim to overshoot those expectations to be rewarded with customer loyalty and repeat business.

                Quickly set a up a self-service help center. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Free up your agents from handling common questions or requests with a branded self-service help center. Easily embed knowledge articles and provide customers access to important data.






            
                Quickly launch personalized portals and communities when your customers need them most. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Build beautifully branded, mobile-responsive portals and communities quickly and easily using Lightning Community Builder. It’s the low-code way to get started with drag-and-drop ease, so you’ll be up and running in no time.









 
    




            
                Simplify self-service with step-by-step processes and end-to-end workflows. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Empower customers to resolve requests on their own — no agent required — by integrating Salesforce data into your portal and business processes. Want to check an account, pay a bill, or book an appointment? It’s all done in a flash.






            
                Scale support with service embedded directly into your portal. 
            
            
            
            
        



	With Service Cloud integration, customers can access an agent via chat or submit a case online. And agents have a 360-degree view of that customer’s activities in the portal. So agents work more efficiently and keep customers happy.









 
    




            
                Help customers help themselves, and each other. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Make it easy for customers to find answers in the community fast by automatically surfacing the information they need from multiple sources. Give access to groups, experts, and customer MVPs to keep them coming back.






            
                Deliver a personalized customer experience using automation and chatbots. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Give your customers answers in real time. With Einstein, you can fine-tune content based on customer profiles, interests, and activities by highlighting relevant articles, answers, and experts. Plus collect case details and handle FAQs on chat before transferring to an agent.

                    How can Service Cloud help my business increase loyalty, retention, and satisfaction?
                





When your customers have questions, your customer service team needs to be equipped to answer them quickly and easily. When your customer service is frictionless, customers are more likely to return to your product or service. Service Cloud gives agents the tools to deliver an outstanding customer experience, enabling them to work faster and more productively, which improves customer satisfaction and reduces costs. And with Service Cloud and Customer Communities, you can create a self-service community that allows customers to tap into the best information about your product, connect with peers, or contact a support agent when needed.

                    How does Service Cloud increase agent productivity?
                





	The Salesforce Lightning Console was designed with agent productivity in mind. With features such as email to case, skills-based routing, macros, and milestone tracking, Service Cloud gives agents the tools to quickly and efficiently respond to customers on any channel. Agents enjoy a streamlined, intuitive experience that gives them a 360-degree view of your customers, a comprehensive knowledge base, and access to company experts. It’s not just about your agents; your entire organization can glean insights from a case history or help provide technical expertise that answers a common service question.

                    What is social customer service and how can this help my business?
                





	Treat social channels just like email and phone. Listen and respond to customers across a variety of social platforms and automatically route social cases to the right agent at the right time. Because social customer service is an integrated, seamless part of Salesforce Customer 360, your social care team gains a comprehensive picture of the customer before responding. This 360-degree view of the customer empowers agents with the ability to engage customers on the social channels where they are talking.

                    What is a self-service community and how can it help my business?
                





A self-service community is a customer portal that allows you to help customers help themselves. Delivering self-service means showcasing your knowledge base and offering case management to customers, so they can get answers to their questions anytime, on any device, from community content or peers. This allows your agents to focus on solving the most complex issues. And you can even create an internal self-service community for your employees to collaborate around content and business processes. 

With Service Cloud and Community Cloud, you can deliver a self-service community or customer portal that is an extension of your brand, while enabling agents to jump on the case when needed, so no question goes unanswered. Extend your support via a fully branded experience where customers — and employees — can tap into articles and discussions, and ask questions of other community members or agents with Service Cloud and Community Cloud.

	Address incidents quickly by ensuring your teams can identify, track, and fix issues with proven workflows. Create an even better customer experience with Incident Management best practices built into the #1 service platform.

                Manage incidents from a single screen. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Give agents and service operations teams full visibility into incidents, cases, and customer data in a single workspace. Agents are no longer left in the dark while being bombarded by frustrated customers. And service operations teams have all the context they need to resolve the problem.















 
    










            
                Stay one step ahead of major disruptions. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Proactively address problems before customers even know about them. Integrate with external systems so you can find and resolve issues before they have widespread impact.














 
    




            
                Automate processes with intelligence. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Use AI to point out incidents based on high volumes of similar incoming cases. Then, expedite the problem solving process with automatically surfaced learnings from previous incidents.















 
    










            
                Find the right experts at the right time. 
            
            
            
            
        



Slack helps you quickly take action by connecting the right experts across internal and external teams. With swarming built into the console, you can tackle incidents and escalations faster and more efficiently than ever before.














 
    




            
                Keep customers in the know. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Build trust and confidence between you and your customers by updating them on the status of their cases. Seamlessly connect with customers and keep them updated using digital channels like email, messaging, social, and web – all native to the Salesforce platform. When customers know their case is actively being worked on, they’re less likely to reach out to the call center.

                Save your agents time using a powerful, connected workspace. 
            
            
            
            
        



	The key to a better customer experience is a better agent experience. Equip your team with an omni-channel console, built-in productivity tools, automation, AI, and a unified view of every case detail and customer interaction.

                Boost agent productivity with intelligent tools and automation. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Automate routine tasks and help agents solve cases faster with contextual business processes. Prepopulate case fields and deliver AI-powered next-step recommendations right in the agent workspace. Enable case-swarming and cross-functional collaboration directly in the agent workspace using Quip.






            
                Personalize every conversation using a 360-degree view of each customer. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Tailor your support to match each customer. Get a complete view of your customer by connecting data across departments and back-end systems into one space for your agents. And solve cases faster by providing context for each support case, like the articles a customer reads on self-service portals.









 
    




            
                Customize the console view for every agent, use case, and channel. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Help agents solve cases more easily by putting the information they need front and center on a personalizable workspace. Easily build a custom page layout for any use case with drag-and-drop UI and prebuilt or custom components.

                Prioritize essential projects and intelligently assign jobs, from anywhere. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Leverage automation to prioritize essential jobs — and save employees time — by intelligently assigning the right workers to the right projects based on skills, location, and business rules. Increase efficiency by giving dispatchers full visibility into the mobile workforce and every job on a single screen.






            
                Harness the power of Einstein AI to increase first-time fix rate. 
            
            
            
            
        



With Einstein Vision, mobile employees can use image recognition to immediately identify assets and parts in images. Ensure the right product part is fixed or replaced to eliminate confusion and additional trips back to the office. Based on an image’s classification, you can automatically prescribe the right set up steps for technicians, so they can provide faster, smarter service.

	Help your team efficiently manage essential work, even when they’re offline, with the Field Service mobile app.* Keep your mobile workers up to date on the latest policies and procedures with step-by-step instructions and safety checklists. Customize the app to improve first-time fix rates by attaching relevant specs, knowledge articles, timesheets, and inventory before workers enter a job site.
















            
                Make data-driven decisions faster. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Use Field Service Analytics to give your managers and dispatchers easy, real-time visibility into operational performance and KPIs, from any location. Drill into all your data from multiple systems and even track safety protocols, all in one app.

                        Are there upfront costs or additional fees?
                    





	Salesforce has all kinds of add-ons, apps, and additional products to help your company stay ahead in your industry. Call us at 1-800-667-6389 to discuss exactly what kind of products you’re looking to add and how we can help.












                        What if my business priorities and product needs have changed?
                    





	We know things don’t always go according to plan, and we’re here and will try our best to support. Reach out to a sales representative at 1-800-667-6389 to discuss options.












                        Do Salesforce products integrate with outside applications and systems?
                    





	In many cases, Salesforce products integrate directly with many outside applications and systems to help you connect your data. For those that don’t have built-in integration, like on-premises data sources, you can purchase licenses of MuleSoft, work with our integration partners, or use apps on AppExchange. 

Talk to a sales representative to get an idea of what integration solution works best with the Salesforce products you use.












                        What support and service packages are available?
                    





	We offer several advisory, adoption, and support plans to our customers. To learn more, visit Success Cloud.












                        Can I pay monthly?
                    





	You can purchase licenses of Salesforce Essentials with a monthly or annual contract. To get started, sign up and purchase Salesforce Essentials directly from a free trial. All other subscriptions are generally paid annually in advance.












                        How long are your contracts?
                    





	Most Salesforce products use annual contracts, but Salesforce subscription terms vary, like Salesforce Essentials which offers monthly or even multiyear payment options. Chat with a sales representative to discuss payment and billing options for your products.












                        Can I upgrade at any time? Can I add more products later on?
                    





	You can add products or upgrade at any time, but some products may need to scale together. Reach out to our sales department at 1-800-667-6389 to see what works for your business.

                        What is CRM?
                    





CRM stands for customer relationship management, which is a solution for storing and managing prospect and customer information, like contact info, accounts, leads, and sales opportunities — all in one central location. But, it’s not just a fancy contact list. A CRM solution is one of the most valuable, game-changing pieces of business technology available because of how it uses that customer info.

                        How can CRM help me make more sales?
                    





At the heart of a CRM solution is something called “sales force automation” (SFA). SFA combined with CRM automates some sales functions, so you can accelerate and streamline the sales process. For instance, instead of being mired down in yellow sticky note reminders or buried in spreadsheets and Google Docs, you can move leads through your sales team quickly and easily, as a team.

A CRM system gives you a quick way to score and route leads, track opportunities and activities, and gain visibility into deal stages and business health for both prospects and customers. And, it holds a record of your business’ ongoing relationship with those contacts. Details can contain everything from call logs, call notes, deal conversations, and quotes, to shared files that are relevant to the customer’s needs, and so much more. So now anyone with access to the record can speak to the customer with confidence. Additionally, you can create daily to-do lists, schedule call alerts, trigger emails, and more. Most companies using a CRM solution find their deal cycles shortened considerably.

                        Can a CRM solution help me find more leads?
                    





The right CRM solution can give you access to contact databases that can be filtered to find your ideal prospects and decision makers within a company, provide social data on those contacts, and deliver insights into what customers are talking about. This makes territory planning and white space analysis easier as well.
How a CRM Helps Your Business Grow

	A complete CRM solution also helps companies run and track marketing campaigns, including marketing communications and delivery automation. It can even help create forms for lead capture and track performance. And for those leads that are not sales ready, you can even automatically put them in a nurture track so that when you do call, they are more likely to buy.












                        How can CRM help me keep my customers happy?
                    





With solutions that range form self-help pages (that allow agents to focus on the tough cases), to full call centers, CRM brings immense value to customer service teams. Your service reps can also use it to generate service tickets and keep track of all your customers’ contact with your service department. And, because the entire system is connected, account reps and every other relevant department will be fully aware of customers’ issues, so everyone can be a service agent when you need them to be.
Insights about customer service issues can be shared and added to a knowledge base so that agents can help customers even faster. In addition to shortening case resolution time, this kind of connected service also makes agents happier. It all comes down to giving them the tools to do more for customers — which in turn drives customer loyalty and referrals.
Overview: What Is Customer Service?
READ THE ARTICLE












                        Is CRM worth it if I’ve got a smaller customer base?
                    





	Yes. If you have customers, you can benefit from CRM. Even if your customer base is small, no one can keep every interaction — ones that have already happened, or need to happen — memorized and organized. It’s a powerful business tool that streamlines processes, gives valuable business insights, and virtually connects employees at your company so they can collaborate as a team, in real time. That’s something businesses of any size can use.












                        How will CRM save me time?
                    





A huge benefit of CRM is automating routine — yet time-sapping — tasks, which saves countless hours. This allows more time for selling.
For example, say you want to send an email follow-up as part of a marketing effort. With a good CRM solution, you don’t have to remember which leads you want to target. You can simply create some rules around your leads and automate the marketing effort, like email campaigns and lead capture, so leads are quickly routed to reps to be either followed up with or nurtured. Creating email templates in the CRM solution ensures you don’t have to repeat the work or even cut and paste.
The result? You can jump on opportunities more quickly and close more deals, faster. CRM also enables you to take data like pipeline size or deal size and create dashboards to help you make informed decisions at a glance. You can quickly check in on the health of deals, revenues, and more.

                        Does CRM help my teams work better together?
                    





A CRM solution makes the same information accessible companywide. This means almost any customer-focused activity can be better and more easily coordinated — within and across departments, from sales to customer service. Also, because account data and activity is updated in real time, every team member is always working with up-to-the-minute information on customers and your company’s interactions with them, like stages in the sales cycle, service issues, or order status.
Salesforce makes collaboration between teams even easier with Chatter, a social network designed for business productivity. Chatter allows team members to share files, find experts, and work on projects to help every employee do more with less.

                        Is CRM customizable for my business?
                    





Every business runs differently, with different processes and ideas of success. This means a good CRM solution should be easily customizable and have an information hierarchy that puts what’s important to you, front and center. The best CRMs feature drag-and-drop customization capabilities, and then deliver regular upgrades automatically that won’t break those customizations — with little or no need for IT involvement.

                        Can I add functions and features without coding and IT help?
                    





It would be hard to find a company that doesn’t use email or other basic business applications on a daily basis. Top-notch CRM offerings help you extend the power of those systems by plugging into them, integrating in a snap with programs like Outlook or QuickBooks. You can even quickly download and integrate business apps, giving you the features and capabilities your business needs, when you need them.

                        What are the different kinds of CRM solutions?
                    





Though there are many CRM providers, there are two main types of CRM solutions that companies can choose, depending on their needs and budget. 
On-Premises CRM
Housed at the location of the business that uses it, on-premises solutions require the up-front purchase of servers or datacenter equipment and the installation of CRM software and middleware by IT staff. It also requires IT for ongoing maintenance and updates. In some cases, you may even need to build the software yourself.
CRM in the Cloud
Cloud-based CRM solutions provide world-class solutions through any browser or mobile device and are instantly scalable, requiring no on-site IT staff. Essentially, CRM in the cloud allows you to pull up a login page through a browser like Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, or Firefox. You simply log in with a username and password, and your CRM is right there. Even better, the mobile functionality of cloud CRM solutions has cut the tethers for reps and managers on the go.

If you’re still not sure if your small business would benefit from CRM, below are some clues that can help you in your decision.

You have teams that work closely together, even when not actually together
Your sales teams are often on the road
You are unable to quickly find customer data to make decisions fast
You feel deals are falling through the cracks because you’re managing things in spreadsheets and notebooks
You have a patchwork of apps that you call CRM but they are not really connected on top of a single database or “system of record”
Your business is growing more quickly than you feel ready for
You know that your business’ customer service experience is lacking or you are losing more customers because of service issues than you’d like
You or your IT department is buried with maintenance requests

                “What Is CRM?” from Salesforce. 
            
            
            
            
        



	“CRM” is an abbreviation for Customer Relationship Management, a methodology and system that helps businesses and organizations track and manage information about prospects, leads, opportunities, customers, and clients.

	Many small businesses find it challenging to fill their sales pipeline in today’s marketing landscape. Traditional marketing strategies do not always work as well as they used to. Salesforce SMB solutions organize your digital marketing into a central hub that connects all the moving parts into a powerful, lead generating system.

You can smartly segment prospects, so you are able to send the right messages to the right targets. Or, easily create nurture campaigns that educate your future customers, so they are “sales ready” before you send them to your sales team. Our platform also allows you to create compelling pro-grade emails, landing pages, and forms without knowing HTML.

Salesforce helps you find customers, win customers, and keep customers. Create your own success story and start growing your small business.
