How Public Sector Organizations Will Transform in 2022These emerging trends in areas that include remote work, employee experience, and data security are poised to define the year ahead. 


 


					Paul Tatum				


							EVP, Solution Engineering, Global Public Sector						












Jan 05, 2022
7 min read


























We all talk a lot about how technology is shaping the future. After all, technology is seemingly everywhere, and certainly at the center of our interactions with most institutions. This is becoming increasingly true for the way public sector organizations worldwide connect with their communities.
Public sector organizations are critical to the personal and professional lives of every member of our society. When these organizations make decisions, they affect the trajectory of global economies and health initiatives, environment sustainability, equity practices, data privacy standards, and a host of other impact areas. 
I asked five Salesforce industry experts to share their observations on market motions that continue to gain momentum from the past two years of rapid learning and growth, as well as emerging trends that are poised to define the year ahead. They shared their best ideas and shed some light on what it all means for the global public sector outlook. 
Among the common themes: the continued rise of remote work, an emphasis on employee experience, trusted and responsible enterprises, increased data security, and work automation through AI. Here’s what they had to say. 
1. Employee experience will take a lead in digital transformation plans— Mia Jordan, digital transformation executive, public sector
In our new success-from-anywhere world, we must optimize processes and technology to enable people to do their best work and collaborate in creative ways regardless of location. This all-digital, work-from-anywhere landscape will endure, continuing far beyond the pandemic. In fact, one-third of global civil servants will become permanent hybrid workers, and many organizations are now permanently changing the way they work. This poses a unique challenge for government workers, who often do not have all the digital tools to carry out their mission in this new virtual world. 
Organizations that focus on employee experience as well as customer experience see exponential growth in employee engagement and realize significant productivity gains. To add another layer to this perspective, when we’re discussing how to best leverage digital service delivery and digital tools, not only would the public sector benefit from placing additional emphasis on transforming the back office but it’s important to note that declining to do so will ultimately result in a much slower return on your digital investments. In short, maintaining the status quo in this scenario has the potential to have detrimental impacts.
Enhancing the citizen experience requires an investment in new tools, capabilities and processes. Making investments in these areas will yield long-term benefits like a workforce with higher morale — and a desire to stay.Mia jordan, digital transformation executive
As a result, we expect to see the public sector continue to increase its focus on digitizing and automating HR-related processes like onboarding and provisioning. Additionally, governments must be more open to leveraging emerging technologies to build cultures of inclusivity, attract and retain the best talent, and offer opportunities for employees to continually upskill and sharpen their ability to compete in the digital economy. 
For organizations to stay ahead of the curve, they must refocus and provide their teams with a modernized approach to the employee life cycle. Making it easier for employees to meet their needs and do their jobs remotely means better results for everyone.
2. Focusing on ESG initiatives is the rule — not the exception—Sunya Norman, vice president of ESG strategy and engagement
By 2029, the Millennial and Gen Z generations will make up 72% of the world’s workforce. These generations put more focus on environmental and social concerns than their predecessors do – and expect more from employers on these issues. 
Stakeholders will continue to push for greater environmental, social, and governance (ESG) accountability and transparency from companies and government organizations to ensure that policies are being developed that not only improve service delivery and economic outcomes but also improve society. 
Public sector agencies have the power to implement new behaviors, operating models, and policies that work toward the greater good of the planet and society and, going into the next year, this is where we’ll see a growing focus.
The call for net-zero commitments and broader, more standardized ESG practices has never been louder. Public sector organizations, including government agencies and private sector contractors alike, play a huge role. Many organizations have chosen to align with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, which cover a wide breadth of ESG-related impact areas. 
Stakeholders increasingly expect businesses and governments to focus on ESG excellence. They’re demanding that we step up and take action.Sunya Norman, vice president of ESG strategy and engagement
As the world’s largest employer and a large user of energy, the public sector now has an opportunity to lead the way in accelerating positive change. In 2022 and beyond, there are a multitude of opportunities for governments and government contractors to take advantage of more sustainable solutions from their technology providers. 
Moving into the new year, public sector organizations that hope to maintain growth and relevance will lean into opportunities to uncover areas to optimize and advance ESG initiatives, adopt more sustainable practices in how they acquire and use technology, and prioritize transparency amongst stakeholders.
3. Trust is an invaluable – and often overlooked – component of success— Eva Skidmore, vice president of marketing, global public sector
We surveyed 24,500 people across 36 countries about using digital channels for government services, and 87% of them said that an exceptional digital government customer experience would increase their degree of trust. While trust may not lead most digital transformation conversations, our public sector customers know all too well that trust can make operations more efficient.



			Rebuilding trust with the public is essential for governments to get communities back on track following the global pandemic

Constituents now expect the same efficiency from the government that they get from the private sector. That gap between digital expectation and delivery has widened but the good news is that governments are open to change.
It is still true that public sector organizations often have to contend with processes that are usually more complex and require more time to navigate, which means adopting new tools and processes. That often presents unique challenges that private sector organizations don’t face. Change is not only possible, it’s inevitable and can be realized much faster with a solid transformation roadmap that leads with constituent and customer trust in mind.
4. Future-proofing data will produce a higher ROI—Nasi Jazayeri, executive vice president and general manager, public sector
As the global workforce continues to adapt to flexible, work-from-anywhere conditions, security and accessibility are becoming increasingly important for all organizations. Whether it’s empowering employees, enabling government agencies to deliver services, or engaging customers remotely, authentication and accessibility are testing the limits of zero trust security architectures. Unfortunately, they’re also constantly creating new threat vectors for attackers. 
Ransomware in particular has set new records in 2021, and many global government organizations have begun to ask how to implement zero trust architectures to safeguard data and maintain public trust in government systems.
Public sector organizations will need to maintain strong cybersecurity standards and ensure technology platforms are built to national and international compliance standards. In addition, they need to scale safely and keep risks – and total cost of ownership – low, without sacrificing the need to accelerate delivery times to market.
Speed is still a key component of success in today’s environment of accelerated digitization, but we’ve also seen growth in the IT delivery gap between what users need and what IT teams are resourced to deliver. And this growing delivery gap underscores another underlying risk: relying on legacy processes and systems that cannot meet modern demands.
Looking ahead, public sector organizations have a wonderful opportunity to preserve their current data by building on the foundation of existing systems. They can roll that data into new, integrated, purpose-built platform solutions that fully conform to end-to-end security and compliance standards. Agencies will look to ‘future-ready’ and ‘future-proof’ solutions that allow them to evolve at the speed of innovation.
5. AI will introduce new ways to bridge the gap between process and people— Nadia Hansen, digital transformation executive, public sector, state and local
Creating smooth and seamless processes takes considerable time, money, and effort. It is hard to be agile and adapt to changing business needs with complex process logic and data in disparate systems. Orchestrating work across multiple departments amongst siloed teams that have their own processes complicates things further. This is where we have seen the most uptake in applications that use leading-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.
The ability to automate repetitive, low-impact tasks frees up employees to focus on high-impact strategic work and gives organizations the leverage to scale — especially public sector organizations that respond to rapidly changing constituent and business needs. 
Looking ahead, public sector organizations are well-served to continue prioritizing the use of automation tools. Equity is an imperative part of the conversations we should be having about how to use these technologies to better serve a broad and increasingly diverse constituency. 
Remember that technology is only as good as its source of information. Public sector organizations can build human-centered models using data that is highly representative of the needs of the populations that benefit from them. Continually testing these systems to both mitigate the risk of bias and diversify representative data can accelerate transformation across your organization in a fair and equitable way. 
Leading-edge technology, like artificial intelligence (AI), has the potential to benefit public-sector organizations in a multitude of ways – from smarter policymaking to reimagined service delivery. If implemented in smart ways, public sector organizations can ensure they strike a balance that keeps people at the center of the good business they’re doing.

Paul Tatum											, Solution Engineering, Global Public Sector						Jan 05, 20227 min readWe all talk a lot about how technology is shaping the future. After all, technology is seemingly everywhere, and certainly at the center of our interactions with most institutions. This is becoming increasingly true for the way public sector organizations worldwide connect with their communities.Public sector organizations are critical to the personal and professional lives of every member of our society. When these organizations make decisions, they affect the trajectory of global economies and health initiatives, environment sustainability, equity practices, data privacy standards, and a host of other impact areas. I asked five Salesforce industry experts to share their observations on market motions that continue to gain momentum from the past two years of rapid learning and growth, as well as emerging trends that are poised to define the year ahead. They shared their best ideas and shed some light on what it all means for the global public sector outlook. Among the common themes: the continued rise of remote work, an emphasis on employee experience, trusted and responsible enterprises, increased data security, and work automation through . Here’s what they had to say. 1. Employee experience will take a lead in digital transformation plans— Mia Jordan, digital transformation executive, public sectorIn our new success-from-anywhere world, we must optimize processes and technology to enable people to do their best work and collaborate in creative ways regardless of location. This all-digital, work-from-anywhere landscape will endure, continuing far beyond the pandemic. In fact, one-third of global civil servants will become permanent hybrid workers, and many organizations are now permanently changing the way they work. This poses a unique challenge for government workers, who often do not have all the digital tools to carry out their mission in this new virtual world. Organizations that focus on employee experience as well as customer experience see exponential growth in employee engagement and realize significant productivity gains. To add another layer to this perspective, when we’re discussing how to best leverage digital service delivery and digital tools, not only would the public sector benefit from placing additional emphasis on transforming the back office but it’s important to note that declining to do so will ultimately result in a much slower return on your digital investments. In short, maintaining the status quo in this scenario has the potential to have detrimental impacts.Enhancing the citizen experience requires an investment in new tools, capabilities and processes. Making investments in these areas will yield long-term benefits like a workforce with higher morale — and a desire to stay.Mia jordan, digital transformation executiveAs a result, we expect to see the public sector continue to increase its focus on digitizing and automating -related processes like onboarding and provisioning. Additionally, governments must be more open to leveraging emerging technologies to build cultures of inclusivity, attract and retain the best talent, and offer opportunities for employees to continually upskill and sharpen their ability to compete in the digital economy. For organizations to stay ahead of the curve, they must refocus and provide their teams with a modernized approach to the employee life cycle. Making it easier for employees to meet their needs and do their jobs remotely means better results for everyone.2. Focusing on  initiatives is the rule — not the exception—Sunya Norman, vice president of  strategy and engagementBy 2029, the Millennial and Gen Z generations will make up 72% of the world’s workforce. These generations put more focus on environmental and social concerns than their predecessors do – and expect more from employers on these issues. Stakeholders will continue to push for greater environmental, social, and governance () accountability and transparency from companies and government organizations to ensure that policies are being developed that not only improve service delivery and economic outcomes but also improve society. Public sector agencies have the power to implement new behaviors, operating models, and policies that work toward the greater good of the planet and society and, going into the next year, this is where we’ll see a growing focus.The call for net-zero commitments and broader, more standardized  practices has never been louder. Public sector organizations, including government agencies and private sector contractors alike, play a huge role. Many organizations have chosen to align with the ’s Sustainable Development Goals, which cover a wide breadth of -related impact areas. Stakeholders increasingly expect businesses and governments to focus on  excellence. They’re demanding that we step up and take action.Sunya Norman, vice president of  strategy and engagementAs the world’s largest employer and a large user of energy, the public sector now has an opportunity to lead the way in accelerating positive change. In 2022 and beyond, there are a multitude of opportunities for governments and government contractors to take advantage of more sustainable solutions from their technology providers. Moving into the new year, public sector organizations that hope to maintain growth and relevance will lean into opportunities to uncover areas to optimize and advance  initiatives, adopt more sustainable practices in how they acquire and use technology, and prioritize transparency amongst stakeholders.3. Trust is an invaluable – and often overlooked – component of success— Eva Skidmore, vice president of marketing, global public sectorWe surveyed 24,500 people across 36 countries about using digital channels for government services, and 87% of them said that an exceptional digital government customer experience would increase their degree of trust. While trust may not lead most digital transformation conversations, our public sector customers know all too well that trust can make operations more efficient.			Rebuilding trust with the public is essential for governments to get communities back on track following the global pandemic		Learn how to tackle the trust deficit with new and innovative approaches to service delivery.read the reportConstituents now expect the same efficiency from the government that they get from the private sector. That gap between digital expectation and delivery has widened but the good news is that governments are open to change.It is still true that public sector organizations often have to contend with processes that are usually more complex and require more time to navigate, which means adopting new tools and processes. That often presents unique challenges that private sector organizations don’t face. Change is not only possible, it’s inevitable and can be realized much faster with a solid transformation roadmap that leads with constituent and customer trust in mind.4. Future-proofing data will produce a higher —Nasi Jazayeri, executive vice president and general manager, public sectorAs the global workforce continues to adapt to flexible, work-from-anywhere conditions, security and accessibility are becoming increasingly important for all organizations. Whether it’s empowering employees, enabling government agencies to deliver services, or engaging customers remotely, authentication and accessibility are testing the limits of zero trust security architectures. Unfortunately, they’re also constantly creating new threat vectors for attackers. Ransomware in particular has set new records in 2021, and many global government organizations have begun to ask how to implement zero trust architectures to safeguard data and maintain public trust in government systems.Public sector organizations will need to maintain strong cybersecurity standards and ensure technology platforms are built to national and international compliance standards. In addition, they need to scale safely and keep risks – and total cost of ownership – low, without sacrificing the need to accelerate delivery times to market.Speed is still a key component of success in today’s environment of accelerated digitization, but we’ve also seen growth in the  delivery gap between what users need and what  teams are resourced to deliver. And this growing delivery gap underscores another underlying risk: relying on legacy processes and systems that cannot meet modern demands.Looking ahead, public sector organizations have a wonderful opportunity to preserve their current data by building on the foundation of existing systems. They can roll that data into new, integrated, purpose-built platform solutions that fully conform to end-to-end security and compliance standards. Agencies will look to ‘future-ready’ and ‘future-proof’ solutions that allow them to evolve at the speed of innovation.5.  will introduce new ways to bridge the gap between process and people— Nadia Hansen, digital transformation executive, public sector, state and localCreating smooth and seamless processes takes considerable time, money, and effort.

Employee experience will take a lead in digital transformation plans— Mia Jordan, digital transformation executive, public sectorIn our new success-from-anywhere world, we must optimize processes and technology to enable people to do their best work and collaborate in creative ways regardless of location. Making investments in these areas will yield long-term benefits like a workforce with higher morale — and a desire to stay.Mia jordan, digital transformation executiveAs a result, we expect to see the public sector continue to increase its focus on digitizing and automating -related processes like onboarding and provisioning. Public sector agencies have the power to implement new behaviors, operating models, and policies that work toward the greater good of the planet and society and, going into the next year, this is where we’ll see a growing focus.The call for net-zero commitments and broader, more standardized  practices has never been louder. Trust is an invaluable – and often overlooked – component of success— Eva Skidmore, vice president of marketing, global public sectorWe surveyed 24,500 people across 36 countries about using digital channels for government services, and 87% of them said that an exceptional digital government customer experience would increase their degree of trust. That gap between digital expectation and delivery has widened but the good news is that governments are open to change.It is still true that public sector organizations often have to contend with processes that are usually more complex and require more time to navigate, which means adopting new tools and processes. Future-proofing data will produce a higher —Nasi Jazayeri, executive vice president and general manager, public sectorAs the global workforce continues to adapt to flexible, work-from-anywhere conditions, security and accessibility are becoming increasingly important for all organizations. Ransomware in particular has set new records in 2021, and many global government organizations have begun to ask how to implement zero trust architectures to safeguard data and maintain public trust in government systems.Public sector organizations will need to maintain strong cybersecurity standards and ensure technology platforms are built to national and international compliance standards. This is where we have seen the most uptake in applications that use leading-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.The ability to automate repetitive, low-impact tasks frees up employees to focus on high-impact strategic work and gives organizations the leverage to scale — especially public sector organizations that respond to rapidly changing constituent and business needs. Looking ahead, public sector organizations are well-served to continue prioritizing the use of automation tools. Leading-edge technology, like artificial intelligence (), has the potential to benefit public-sector organizations in a multitude of ways – from smarter policymaking to reimagined service delivery.

There was a time when seeing your name in an email subject line was enough to make your digital experience feel personalized. Today, however, consumers have higher standards, with 66% of customers expecting companies to understand their unique needs. This data proves that personalized experiences are essential to a business’ success and growth. Personalization is especially critical in the healthcare industry, where customized content is often lacking. Only 40% of consumers say communications from the healthcare and life sciences industries feel relevant.
As a leading fertility-benefits management company, Progyny understood the importance of delivering personalized content to its patients, so company leaders decided to scale their personalization efforts to create experiences unique to their customers’ needs.
Growing from just five customers in 2016 to partnering today with over 180 large employers in 2021, including Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Salesforce, the company needed a way to manage continuous growth and deliver a fantastic member experience unmatched in the industry. It’s safe to say its efforts succeeded. Today, Progyny supports more than 2.8 million members on their path to parenthood. It’s estimated that 10% to 20% of their members are driving interaction through the portal.
Read on to see how the innovative fertility-benefits company turned the insurance model on its head — creating a secure, high-touch digital experience that supports members at every stage of their fertility journey. You can also get tips for how to create a digital experience that scales as your business grows.





            
                “Because we’re a carve-out benefit, everything we do has to be superior to what a traditional health plan would do.”

                1. Offer patients convenience and simplicity. 
            
            
            
            
        



All generations prioritize convenience over brand, according to the 4th edition State of the Connected Consumer. Brands that make it easy to do business will maintain a competitive advantage over those that don’t. In the healthcare industry, self-sufficiency and the ability to easily access health records are important to the patient-provider relationship.
Like many other healthcare companies, Progyny managed a lot of its customer touchpoints through email or over the phone. To offer a more convenient experience, Progyny decided to invest in technology that would save time for its employees, streamline operations for employers, and simplify engagement with patients. This resulted in a one-stop digital experience that incorporates tools from the consumer world, like online appointment requests, bill payment, authorization requests, and streamlined access to the resources members need to understand their benefits and the fertility process.
With Salesforce Experience Cloud, Progyny made it easier for members to self-serve online while empowering fertility specialists to focus on clinical support, while Progyny’s fertility coaches provide emotional support. The improved experience is reflected in the company's Net Promoter Score, which is over 4x higher than the industry average.





            
                “Healthcare — along with the rest of the world — is moving into a digital space. Salesforce enables us to do that well while maintaining an exceptional member experience, which is vital to our core mission and values.”

                2. Involve sales as “change ambassadors.” 
            
            
            
            
        



Data can uncover valuable patterns of how customers have engaged with a brand or business. Web page visits, online communications, and purchases are some examples of behavioral customer data that can help reveal customer profiles and areas of interest.
With a wealth of data in one place, Progyny uses Salesforce to personalize every facet of the member's fertility journey — from care plans to specially curated content, including videos, podcasts, and other vetted resources. For example, a member dealing with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) may receive targeted content that’s relevant to the treatment path she’s considering, and a member who is exploring surrogacy would receive information tailored to her options.
Members are also assigned a dedicated patient care advocate (PCA) to help them understand the risks and benefits of treatment options and provide emotional support through the ups and downs. The 1-to-1 experience between patients and their PCA is one of the primary ways Progyny engages with its members, and technology is the fuel behind the enhanced and tailor-made experience. It’s that level of personalized support — supplemented by resources and information that’s easily accessible through the portal — that inspires deeper patient-provider relationships and ultimately results in better outcomes.





            
                “Babies have been named after our patient care advocates. We’ve created a trust and bond with our members that is unmatched.”

                3. Keep data secure without sacrificing ease of use. 
            
            
            
            
        



Eighty-eight percent of consumers are more loyal to companies they trust. Consumer trust and confidence grow with transparent communications around data. According to the Connected Healthcare Consumer report, one thing consumers evaluate insurers on is quick access to their records.
Being in the healthcare space, Progyny takes patient privacy very seriously. Salesforce’s entire Customer 360 Platform was built with HIPAA compliance in mind, making it easy for the company to maintain control of its data while accommodating HIPAA regulations. Progyny uses Salesforce Shield to assist with HIPAA regulations. There are other tools that also help support a holistic HIPAA-compliant execution on digital experiences such as Marketing Cloud, Heroku, and MuleSoft.
The member portal also gives members private, one-on-one access to their patient care advocate so they can communicate — anytime, anywhere — without having to disclose personal information to everyone around them. This is made possible through Salesforce Chatter, a secure messaging tool which allows Progyny to chat with members securely.





            
                “If they’re in the office, members don’t necessarily want their colleagues hearing about their IVF cycle — so the member portal provides them a way to communicate with their patient care advocate in a safe and private way.” 
            
            
            
            
        



Lissa Kline
SVP, Provider and Member Services, Progyny





            
                4. Build an infrastructure that supports growth and change. 
            
            
            
            
        



The global fertility services market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 8% between 2021–2026, according to a new report by Research and Markets. As more employers offer fertility and family-building benefits, Progyny needed to prepare for massive scale, no matter what curveballs came its way.
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Progyny didn’t skip a beat. That’s because the organization had already invested in the infrastructure needed to provide members with an individualized and seamless digital experience. As its business grows, it is able to scale without compromising experience. As the healthcare industry continues to grapple with ever-changing expectations, Progyny is prepared for a future that promises to be more digital and patient-centric.





            
                “As the CEO, I get to worry about everything. Problems find my desk. One thing I don’t worry about is our technical infrastructure and its ability to suit our needs both now and in the future.”

","From 5 to 180+ Customers: Progyny’s Formula for Personalization and Service at Scale - Salesforce.comSkip to content                                                                                                                                                                                                       From 5 to 180+ Customers: Progyny’s Formula for Personalization and Service at Scale                                                                                          October 2021 • 5-minute read                                                              There was a time when seeing your name in an email subject line was enough to make your digital experience feel personalized. Today, however, consumers have higher standards, with 66% of customers expecting companies to understand their unique needs. This data proves that personalized experiences are essential to a business’ success and growth. Personalization is especially critical in the healthcare industry, where customized content is often lacking. Only 40% of consumers say communications from the healthcare and life sciences industries feel relevant.As a leading fertility-benefits management company, Progyny understood the importance of delivering personalized content to its patients, so company leaders decided to scale their personalization efforts to create experiences unique to their customers’ needs.Growing from just five customers in 2016 to partnering today with over 180 large employers in 2021, including Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Salesforce, the company needed a way to manage continuous growth and deliver a fantastic member experience unmatched in the industry. It’s safe to say its efforts succeeded. Today, Progyny supports more than 2.8 million members on their path to parenthood. It’s estimated that 10% to 20% of their members are driving interaction through the portal.Read on to see how the innovative fertility-benefits company turned the insurance model on its head — creating a secure, high-touch digital experience that supports members at every stage of their fertility journey. You can also get tips for how to create a digital experience that scales as your business grows.                            “Because we’re a carve-out benefit, everything we do has to be superior to what a traditional health plan would do.”                                                         David Schlanger, Progyny                            1. Offer patients convenience and simplicity.                                                         All generations prioritize convenience over brand, according to the 4th edition State of the Connected Consumer. Brands that make it easy to do business will maintain a competitive advantage over those that don’t. In the healthcare industry, self-sufficiency and the ability to easily access health records are important to the patient-provider relationship.Like many other healthcare companies, Progyny managed a lot of its customer touchpoints through email or over the phone. To offer a more convenient experience, Progyny decided to invest in technology that would save time for its employees, streamline operations for employers, and simplify engagement with patients. This resulted in a one-stop digital experience that incorporates tools from the consumer world, like online appointment requests, bill payment, authorization requests, and streamlined access to the resources members need to understand their benefits and the fertility process.With Salesforce Experience Cloud, Progyny made it easier for members to self-serve online while empowering fertility specialists to focus on clinical support, while Progyny’s fertility coaches provide emotional support. The improved experience is reflected in the company's Net Promoter Score, which is over 4x higher than the industry average.                            “Healthcare — along with the rest of the world — is moving into a digital space. Salesforce enables us to do that well while maintaining an exceptional member experience, which is vital to our core mission and values.”                                                         Lissa Kline, Provider and Member Services, Progyny                            2. Involve sales as “change ambassadors.”                                                         Data can uncover valuable patterns of how customers have engaged with a brand or business. Web page visits, online communications, and purchases are some examples of behavioral customer data that can help reveal customer profiles and areas of interest.With a wealth of data in one place, Progyny uses Salesforce to personalize every facet of the member's fertility journey — from care plans to specially curated content, including videos, podcasts, and other vetted resources. For example, a member dealing with polycystic ovarian syndrome () may receive targeted content that’s relevant to the treatment path she’s considering, and a member who is exploring surrogacy would receive information tailored to her options.Members are also assigned a dedicated patient care advocate () to help them understand the risks and benefits of treatment options and provide emotional support through the ups and downs. The 1-to-1 experience between patients and their  is one of the primary ways Progyny engages with its members, and technology is the fuel behind the enhanced and tailor-made experience. It’s that level of personalized support — supplemented by resources and information that’s easily accessible through the portal — that inspires deeper patient-provider relationships and ultimately results in better outcomes.                            “Babies have been named after our patient care advocates. We’ve created a trust and bond with our members that is unmatched.”                                                         Lissa Kline, Provider and Member Services, Progyny                            3. Keep data secure without sacrificing ease of use.                                                         Eighty-eight percent of consumers are more loyal to companies they trust. Consumer trust and confidence grow with transparent communications around data. According to the Connected Healthcare Consumer report, one thing consumers evaluate insurers on is quick access to their records.Being in the healthcare space, Progyny takes patient privacy very seriously. Salesforce’s entire Customer 360 Platform was built with  compliance in mind, making it easy for the company to maintain control of its data while accommodating  regulations. Progyny uses Salesforce Shield to assist with  regulations. There are other tools that also help support a holistic -compliant execution on digital experiences such as Marketing Cloud, Heroku, and MuleSoft.The member portal also gives members private, one-on-one access to their patient care advocate so they can communicate — anytime, anywhere — without having to disclose personal information to everyone around them. This is made possible through Salesforce Chatter, a secure messaging tool which allows Progyny to chat with members securely.                            “If they’re in the office, members don’t necessarily want their colleagues hearing about their  cycle — so the member portal provides them a way to communicate with their patient care advocate in a safe and private way.”                                                         Lissa Kline, Provider and Member Services, Progyny                            4. Build an infrastructure that supports growth and change.                                                         The global fertility services market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate () of around 8% between 2021–2026, according to a new report by Research and Markets. As more employers offer fertility and family-building benefits, Progyny needed to prepare for massive scale, no matter what curveballs came its way.When the -19 pandemic hit, Progyny didn’t skip a beat. That’s because the organization had already invested in the infrastructure needed to provide members with an individualized and seamless digital experience. As its business grows, it is able to scale without compromising experience. As the healthcare industry continues to grapple with ever-changing expectations, Progyny is prepared for a future that promises to be more digital and patient-centric.                            “As the , I get to worry about everything. Problems find my desk. One thing I don’t worry about is our technical infrastructure and its ability to suit our needs both now and in the future.”                                                         David Schlanger, Progyny                                 Related Content                                                                                     blog                                                                                     Experience Cloud: Easily Build Websites and Apps Personalized for Your Customers                                                                                     demo                                                                                     Experience Cloud Overview Demo                                                         The Forrester Wave™: B2C Experience Suites, Q3 2021                            gated report                                                                                     The Forrester Wave™: Digital Experience Platforms, Q3 2021                                                         The Forrester Wave™: B2C Experience Suites, Q3 2021                                 More Resources                                                              Digital Trends Report                            Gated Report                                                                                     Digital Trends Report                                                         Digital Trends Report                            Blog                                                                                     Calculating : Measure Your Returns on Experience Investments                                                         The Total Economic Impact™ of Salesforce Experience Cloud                            Gated Report                                                                                     The Total Economic Impact of Salesforce Experience Cloud                                                         The Total Economic Impact™ of Salesforce Experience Cloud                                      Get timely updates and fresh ideas delivered to your inbox.

According to the Connected Healthcare Consumer report, one thing consumers evaluate insurers on is quick access to their records.Being in the healthcare space, Progyny takes patient privacy very seriously. There are other tools that also help support a holistic -compliant execution on digital experiences such as Marketing Cloud, Heroku, and MuleSoft.The member portal also gives members private, one-on-one access to their patient care advocate so they can communicate — anytime, anywhere — without having to disclose personal information to everyone around them. “If they’re in the office, members don’t necessarily want their colleagues hearing about their  cycle — so the member portal provides them a way to communicate with their patient care advocate in a safe and private way.”                                                         Lissa Kline, Provider and Member Services, Progyny                            4. The global fertility services market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate () of around 8% between 2021–2026, according to a new report by Research and Markets. As more employers offer fertility and family-building benefits, Progyny needed to prepare for massive scale, no matter what curveballs came its way.When the -19 pandemic hit, Progyny didn’t skip a beat. One thing I don’t worry about is our technical infrastructure and its ability to suit our needs both now and in the future.”                                                         David Schlanger, Progyny                                 Related Content                                                                                     blog                                                                                     Experience Cloud: Easily Build Websites and Apps Personalized for Your Customers                                                                                     demo                                                                                     Experience Cloud Overview Demo                                                         The Forrester Wave™: B2C Experience Suites, Q3 2021                            gated report                                                                                     The Forrester Wave™: Digital Experience Platforms, Q3 2021                                                         The Forrester Wave™: B2C Experience Suites, Q3 2021                                 More Resources                                                              Digital Trends Report                            Gated Report                                                                                     Digital Trends Report                                                         Digital Trends Report                            Blog                                                                                     Calculating : Measure Your Returns on Experience Investments                                                         The Total Economic Impact™ of Salesforce Experience Cloud                            Gated Report                                                                                     The Total Economic Impact of Salesforce Experience Cloud                                                         The Total Economic Impact™ of Salesforce Experience Cloud                                      Get timely updates and fresh ideas delivered to your inbox.

The COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the importance of online sales for B2B companies. More than ever, customers are going online to buy their supplies and equipment. And this trend is only accelerating — according to recent research, 55% of B2B leaders said digital channels would provide more than 50% of revenue in three years.
But many healthcare companies have struggled with this trend, and Ovation Medical — which provides orthopedic and podiatry products to more than 12,000 private practices, medical facilities, and retailers across the U.S. — was no different. The company still relied on in-person and phone orders, even when the pandemic accelerated B2B customers’ shift to online buying. Ovation leaders suspected this low-tech approach was leading to lower sales, and they knew the manual order-taking process impacted the productivity of sales representatives.





            
                “Most of our business comes from repeat orders, but our sales reps were spending most of their time manually inputting up to $10,000 in orders a day. Instead of developing new business, our team was putting in orders all day long.”

VP, Sales



To remove the bottleneck from sales, Ovation Medical deployed a robust digital commerce platform that automated and streamlined repeat business operations and sales processes. They went live in just four weeks. This new portal improved customer experiences, while freeing up sales reps to focus on new business.
Since the deployment of the new site in mid-2020, repeat order processing time has been cut in half. As a result, the productivity of sales reps has doubled — each rep manages up to 400 customer accounts simultaneously — and spends more time landing new business. See their tips for this rapid growth in productivity.







            
                Decide on the right digital commerce solution. 
            
            
            
            
        






Ovation didn't have the infrastructure to deploy a digital commerce platform. The first thing it needed to do was change that.
The distributor already used Sales Cloud to create a centralized view of customers and track sales activities for its small sales team. Using B2B Commerce as the platform for their digital commerce site was a natural fit because B2B Commerce uses the same data model as Sales Cloud so there’s no integration required. It was like turning on digital orders so sales and service reps could get a single view of their customers.





            
                Take a minimum viable product (MVP) approach. 
            
            
            
            
        



Building a digital commerce platform can be slow, tedious, and costly. To speed up and streamline the process, Ovation made two key decisions early on: It would use an MVP approach, and partner with Salesforce implementation partner Forte Group. With the MVP approach, the company was able to roll out features as they were built, so they could start getting value and feedback, while continuing to add new features over time.
Simultaneously, Ovation and Forte Group consulted with Salesforce’s B2B Commerce product managers to build a custom portal that supported well-established business practices.





            
                Get a firm understanding of necessary customizations. 
            
            
            
            
        



	During implementation, project stakeholders shared their requirements. This allowed the implementation teams to create custom features that complemented B2B Commerce’s out-of-box functionality and supported Ovation’s specific order flows for more than 500 active products in different sizes and colors.





            
                Make reordering as simple as clicking a button. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Ovation and Forte Group built self-service and automation into the system. As a result, a customized “Order now” page is created for each registered user, providing them with immediate access to their previous orders with pricing built in. Returning customers can easily reorder any items, update their order, or purchase new products without getting sales reps involved. New customers register on the site and request a follow-up by a sales representative to negotiate pricing. Once pricing is established, reordering is streamlined.





            
                Integrate with other order-related systems. 
            
            
            
            
        



Ovation uses B2B Commerce to create, manage, and track online orders. The portal is integrated with Salesforce CRM and the inventory management system, ensuring the fulfillment process remains uninterrupted.
The Forte Group also built customized features to preserve the standard order process and custom order flows. Orders appear in the CRM as closed and converted to Salesforce opportunities for automated sales pipeline monitoring.





            
                “Now, we can shift our focus to drive incremental business. It puts our current accounts on autopilot, which frees up our reps to engage in meaningful conversations about new products that help our customers. This platform allows us to provide our customers with killer products in a portal that’s so easy to use.”

","How Ovation Medical Deployed a Digital Commerce Site in Four Weeks and Doubled Productivity - Salesforce.comSkip to content                                                                                                                                                                                                       How Ovation Medical Deployed a Digital Commerce Site in Four Weeks and Doubled Productivity                                                                                     The company's portal improved customer experiences and freed up sales to focus on new business.                                                                                          September 2021                                                                                     3.5 min read                                                              The -19 pandemic reinforced the importance of online sales for B2B companies. More than ever, customers are going online to buy their supplies and equipment. And this trend is only accelerating — according to recent research, 55% of B2B leaders said digital channels would provide more than 50% of revenue in three years.But many healthcare companies have struggled with this trend, and Ovation Medical — which provides orthopedic and podiatry products to more than 12,000 private practices, medical facilities, and retailers across the U.S. — was no different. The company still relied on in-person and phone orders, even when the pandemic accelerated B2B customers’ shift to online buying. Ovation leaders suspected this low-tech approach was leading to lower sales, and they knew the manual order-taking process impacted the productivity of sales representatives.                            “Most of our business comes from repeat orders, but our sales reps were spending most of their time manually inputting up to $10,000 in orders a day. Instead of developing new business, our team was putting in orders all day long.”                                                         Erik Rost, SalesTo remove the bottleneck from sales, Ovation Medical deployed a robust digital commerce platform that automated and streamlined repeat business operations and sales processes. They went live in just four weeks. This new portal improved customer experiences, while freeing up sales reps to focus on new business.Since the deployment of the new site in mid-2020, repeat order processing time has been cut in half. As a result, the productivity of sales reps has doubled — each rep manages up to 400 customer accounts simultaneously — and spends more time landing new business. See their tips for this rapid growth in productivity.                            Decide on the right digital commerce solution.                                                         Ovation didn't have the infrastructure to deploy a digital commerce platform. The first thing it needed to do was change that.The distributor already used Sales Cloud to create a centralized view of customers and track sales activities for its small sales team. Using B2B Commerce as the platform for their digital commerce site was a natural fit because B2B Commerce uses the same data model as Sales Cloud so there’s no integration required. It was like turning on digital orders so sales and service reps could get a single view of their customers.                            Take a minimum viable product () approach.                                                         Building a digital commerce platform can be slow, tedious, and costly. To speed up and streamline the process, Ovation made two key decisions early on: It would use an  approach, and partner with Salesforce implementation partner Forte Group. With the  approach, the company was able to roll out features as they were built, so they could start getting value and feedback, while continuing to add new features over time.Simultaneously, Ovation and Forte Group consulted with Salesforce’s B2B Commerce product managers to build a custom portal that supported well-established business practices.                            Get a firm understanding of necessary customizations.                                                         	During implementation, project stakeholders shared their requirements. This allowed the implementation teams to create custom features that complemented B2B Commerce’s out-of-box functionality and supported Ovation’s specific order flows for more than 500 active products in different sizes and colors.                            Make reordering as simple as clicking a button.                                                         	Ovation and Forte Group built self-service and automation into the system. As a result, a customized “Order now” page is created for each registered user, providing them with immediate access to their previous orders with pricing built in. Returning customers can easily reorder any items, update their order, or purchase new products without getting sales reps involved. New customers register on the site and request a follow-up by a sales representative to negotiate pricing. Once pricing is established, reordering is streamlined.                            Integrate with other order-related systems.                                                         Ovation uses B2B Commerce to create, manage, and track online orders. The portal is integrated with Salesforce  and the inventory management system, ensuring the fulfillment process remains uninterrupted.The Forte Group also built customized features to preserve the standard order process and custom order flows. Orders appear in the  as closed and converted to Salesforce opportunities for automated sales pipeline monitoring.                            “Now, we can shift our focus to drive incremental business. It puts our current accounts on autopilot, which frees up our reps to engage in meaningful conversations about new products that help our customers. This platform allows us to provide our customers with killer products in a portal that’s so easy to use.”                                                         Erik Rost, Sales                                 Related Content                                                                                     Blog                                                                                     How To Launch a B2B Commerce Storefront Fast                                                         First Edition: State of Commerce                            report                                                                                     State of Commerce Report                                                         First Edition: State of CommerceB2B Commerce Demo                            demo                                                                                     Give Customers Connected, Relevant B2B Commerce Experiences                                                         B2B Commerce Demo                                 More Resources                                                                                          Webinar                                                                                     Build B2B Commerce Experiences Fast on Lightning feat.

As a result, the productivity of sales reps has doubled — each rep manages up to 400 customer accounts simultaneously — and spends more time landing new business. To speed up and streamline the process, Ovation made two key decisions early on: It would use an  approach, and partner with Salesforce implementation partner Forte Group. With the  approach, the company was able to roll out features as they were built, so they could start getting value and feedback, while continuing to add new features over time.Simultaneously, Ovation and Forte Group consulted with Salesforce’s B2B Commerce product managers to build a custom portal that supported well-established business practices. Returning customers can easily reorder any items, update their order, or purchase new products without getting sales reps involved. Ovation uses B2B Commerce to create, manage, and track online orders. The portal is integrated with Salesforce  and the inventory management system, ensuring the fulfillment process remains uninterrupted.The Forte Group also built customized features to preserve the standard order process and custom order flows. This platform allows us to provide our customers with killer products in a portal that’s so easy to use.”                                                         Erik Rost, Sales                                 Related Content                                                                                     Blog                                                                                     How To Launch a B2B Commerce Storefront Fast                                                         First Edition: State of Commerce                            report                                                                                     State of Commerce Report                                                         First Edition: State of CommerceB2B Commerce Demo                            demo                                                                                     Give Customers Connected, Relevant B2B Commerce Experiences                                                         B2B Commerce Demo                                 More Resources                                                                                          Webinar                                                                                     Build B2B Commerce Experiences Fast on Lightning feat.

	During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, retailers were scrappy — making quick decisions to provide the products and services customers needed — from curbside pickup to virtual styling. These short-term solutions are now scaling as shoppers have more channels, options, and expectations than ever before. Not to mention, they have less patience: In fact, the vast majority (80%) of shoppers will abandon a retailer after three bad experiences.



 
    








of shoppers will abandon a retailer after three bad experiences.









	For the Fourth Edition of the Connected Shoppers Report, Salesforce surveyed 1,600 global shoppers and more than 1,000 retail executives to understand how both rising expectations and the global health crisis are pushing brands and retailers to accelerate digital transformation.



To give brands and retailers the insights they need to move from scrappy to scale, we’ve compiled the top four trends from the report. Findings reveal:
 

Shopping journeys are more complex


The store has gone digital


Experiences and engagement underpin the future of loyalty


Retailers and brands unify digital and physical touchpoints

                Trend #1: Shopping journeys get more complex 
            
            
            
            
        



	Between 2019 and 2021, three types of digital channels grew transaction share by nearly 40%: brand websites and apps, retailer websites and apps, and online marketplaces. Emerging channels like delivery apps, social media, and messaging platforms have also become serious commerce players, with their share of transactions increasing more than 20%.*



*Rate of change = (2021-2019)/2019



 
    








Three types of digital channels grew transaction share by nearly 40%: brand websites and apps, retailer websites and apps, and online marketplaces.









	With the variety of channels continuing to increase, shopping journeys have gotten more complex. There is an acceleration of “shopping at the edge,” where consumers start — and even complete — the shopping journey outside of a brand or retailers’ physical and digital spaces.





            
                “The path to purchase has become fragmented and immersive. Brands must develop one-on-one relationships with consumers across platforms such as social media, messaging apps, and livestreaming to remain relevant.”

	Social media, influencers, and messaging apps are the most popular methods for product discovery. When it’s time to make a purchase, mobile wallets, email, and social media are the top digital destinations. And when shoppers reach out for customer support, 28% turn to chatbots and 23% use social media.










            
                Trend #2: The store goes digital 
            
            
            
            
        



While transactions through brick-and-mortar stores decreased 27% between 2019 and 2021 according to our research, the store still plays a critical role in the shopping journey. In fact, 82% of the $23 trillion worth of sales occurred in physical locations in 2020. The top reasons shoppers visit a physical store are to touch and feel the merchandise, access purchases immediately, and avoid shipping fees.
However, many shoppers are blurring the lines between digital and physical channels while in the store. For example, nearly one in three shoppers have researched a product online using a mobile device while in store, and one in four have scanned a QR code to learn more about a product.
In response, brands and retailers are unifying the in-store experience with a growing number of physical and digital touchpoints.
The role of the associate is evolving as well. During the height of the pandemic, associates went from greeting, scanning, and bagging to becoming customer service agents, virtual stylists, pickers and packers, and brand influencers. Many of these responsibilities are here to stay, which makes the role of the store associate more diverse, strategic, and appealing.





            
                “Store associates are our biggest brand ambassadors. We must do everything we can to make them more productive, empowered, and happy.”

                Trend #3: The loyalty game reaches a new level 
            
            
            
            
        



	Shopper expectations around loyalty programs are evolving. While points-based programs are the most popular type today, data suggests that younger generations are craving experiential programs that instill a genuine and authentic connection. Millennials and Gen Zers value exclusive access to limited products and experiences nearly two times more than Silents/Baby Boomers when it comes to loyalty programs.

Millennials and Gen Zers value exclusive access to limited products and experiences nearly two times more than Silents/Baby Boomers.



Shoppers are also interested in earning rewards for more than just transactions. They are willing to take actions such as downloading an app (57%) or writing an online review (47%) and exchanging certain personal information — like their birthday (67%) or phone number for text messages (51%) — for more personalized experiences and benefits.
This data indicates that brands and retailers have the opportunity to revamp their loyalty programs in terms of types of rewards and actions taken to earn them.










            
                Trend #4: Retailers and brands accelerate unified shopping experiences 
            
            
            
            
        



	While 66% of customers expect companies to understand their unique needs and expectations, only 32% of retail executives say they have the full ability to turn data into personalized prices, offers, and products in real time across channels and touchpoints. A big reason why? The average retail organization uses an estimated 44 different systems to engage customers across touchpoints.

The average retail organization uses an estimated 44 different systems to engage customers across touchpoints.









	To overcome these challenges, retail executives are taking a threefold approach:





            
                Hiring more data scientists 
            
            
            
            
        



	Retail executives estimate that they will employ an average of 76 data scientists by the end of 2021. That number is estimated to grow a further 44% through 2023.





            
                “Data’s important, but we’re using it in places that are not accessible, and in today’s digital transformation, it needs to be there for everyone.”

These short-term solutions are now scaling as shoppers have more channels, options, and expectations than ever before. Not to mention, they have less patience: In fact, the vast majority (80%) of shoppers will abandon a retailer after three bad experiences.     of shoppers will abandon a retailer after three bad experiences.	For the Fourth Edition of the Connected Shoppers Report, Salesforce surveyed 1,600 global shoppers and more than 1,000 retail executives to understand how both rising expectations and the global health crisis are pushing brands and retailers to accelerate digital transformation.To give brands and retailers the insights they need to move from scrappy to scale, we’ve compiled the top four trends from the report.

Emerging channels like delivery apps, social media, and messaging platforms have also become serious commerce players, with their share of transactions increasing more than 20%.**Rate of change = (2021-2019)/2019     Three types of digital channels grew transaction share by nearly 40%: brand websites and apps, retailer websites and apps, and online marketplaces.	With the variety of channels continuing to increase, shopping journeys have gotten more complex. There is an acceleration of “shopping at the edge,” where consumers start — and even complete — the shopping journey outside of a brand or retailers’ physical and digital spaces.                            “The path to purchase has become fragmented and immersive. Brands must develop one-on-one relationships with consumers across platforms such as social media, messaging apps, and livestreaming to remain relevant.”                                                         “The path to purchase has become fragmented and immersive. Brands must develop one-on-one relationships with consumers across platforms such as social media, messaging apps, and live streaming to remain relevant.”        Angelica Munson Global Chief Digital Officer, Shiseido                     lobal Chief Digital Officer, Shiseido      lobal Chief Digital Officer, Shiseido	Social media, influencers, and messaging apps are the most popular methods for product discovery. When it’s time to make a purchase, mobile wallets, email, and social media are the top digital destinations. And when shoppers reach out for customer support, 28% turn to chatbots and 23% use social media.                            Trend #2: The store goes digital                                                         While transactions through brick-and-mortar stores decreased 27% between 2019 and 2021 according to our research, the store still plays a critical role in the shopping journey. In fact, 82% of the $23 trillion worth of sales occurred in physical locations in 2020. The top reasons shoppers visit a physical store are to touch and feel the merchandise, access purchases immediately, and avoid shipping fees.However, many shoppers are blurring the lines between digital and physical channels while in the store. For example, nearly one in three shoppers have researched a product online using a mobile device while in store, and one in four have scanned a  code to learn more about a product.In response, brands and retailers are unifying the in-store experience with a growing number of physical and digital touchpoints.The role of the associate is evolving as well. During the height of the pandemic, associates went from greeting, scanning, and bagging to becoming customer service agents, virtual stylists, pickers and packers, and brand influencers. Many of these responsibilities are here to stay, which makes the role of the store associate more diverse, strategic, and appealing.                            “Store associates are our biggest brand ambassadors. We must do everything we can to make them more productive, empowered, and happy.”                                                         “Store associates are our biggest brand ambassadors. We must do everything we can to make them more productive, empowered, and happy.”        John Hazen Chief Digital Officer, Boot Barn                     hief Digital Officer, Boot Barn      hief Digital Officer, Boot Barn                            Trend #3: The loyalty game reaches a new level                                                         	Shopper expectations around loyalty programs are evolving. While points-based programs are the most popular type today, data suggests that younger generations are craving experiential programs that instill a genuine and authentic connection. Millennials and Gen Zers value exclusive access to limited products and experiences nearly two times more than Silents/Baby Boomers when it comes to loyalty programs.                                 Millennials and Gen Zers value exclusive access to limited products and experiences nearly two times more than Silents/Baby Boomers.                                                         Millennials and Gen Zers value exclusive access to limited products and experiences nearly two times more than Silents/Baby Boomers.Shoppers are also interested in earning rewards for more than just transactions. They are willing to take actions such as downloading an app (57%) or writing an online review (47%) and exchanging certain personal information — like their birthday (67%) or phone number for text messages (51%) — for more personalized experiences and benefits.This data indicates that brands and retailers have the opportunity to revamp their loyalty programs in terms of types of rewards and actions taken to earn them.                            Trend #4: Retailers and brands accelerate unified shopping experiences                                                         	While 66% of customers expect companies to understand their unique needs and expectations, only 32% of retail executives say they have the full ability to turn data into personalized prices, offers, and products in real time across channels and touchpoints. A big reason why? The average retail organization uses an estimated 44 different systems to engage customers across touchpoints.                                 The average retail organization uses an estimated 44 different systems to engage customers across touchpoints.                                                         The average retail organization uses an estimated 44 different systems to engage customers across touchpoints.	To overcome these challenges, retail executives are taking a threefold approach:                            Hiring more data scientists                                                         	Retail executives estimate that they will employ an average of 76 data scientists by the end of 2021. That number is estimated to grow a further 44% through 2023.                            “Data’s important, but we’re using it in places that are not accessible, and in today’s digital transformation, it needs to be there for everyone.”                                                         “Data’s important, but we’re using it in places that are not accessible, and in today’s digital transformation, it needs to be there for everyone.”        Karen Beebe  and , Operations of vineyard vines                      and , Operations of vineyard vines                              Read More                     and , Operations of vineyard vines                              Read More                                          Adopting a unified engagement platform                                                         	Fifty-five percent of retail executives say their organization is in some form of the planning stage for this type of platform, which enables retailers to access and operationalize customer data across marketing, commerce, and service.     of retail executives say their organization is still in the planning stage for a unified engagement platform.

For the Fourth Edition of the Connected Shoppers Report, Salesforce surveyed 1,600 global shoppers and more than 1,000 retail executives to understand how both rising expectations and the global health crisis are pushing brands and retailers to accelerate digital transformation.To give brands and retailers the insights they need to move from scrappy to scale, we’ve compiled the top four trends from the report. 3 Myths (and Truths) From 4 Generations of Global Shoppers                                                                                     Blog                                                                                     Even In-Person Shopping is Becoming More Digital                                                                                     Blog                                                                                     vineyard vines  Believes Data is for Everyone                                                                                                    Get the Fourth Edition Connected Shoppers Report                                                         Discover the latest retail trends and insights, including:Why shoppers choose different shopping destinations and channelsHow brands and retailers are accelerating changeWhat the future holds for the store                            Fill out the form to get the report.

	Communications service providers (CSPs) are inherently innovators. With the advent of 5G technology, they are primed to tap new business models that extend the network across industries beyond what was possible before. 



	And digital commerce is fast becoming a primary driver of growth.



	The pandemic was a wake-up call, forcing CSPs to take a hard look at their existing digital commerce capabilities. Sixty-four percent of CSPs invested more in commerce in 2020 than the prior year. Now, 90% of communications leaders are maintaining or growing their investment in digital experiences.



	To keep a winner’s pace, CSPs must master the entire digital commerce experience. 



	This guide will show you how to take digital commerce to the next level in your organization.

	Without customer trust, what do you have? Security has always been a priority for commerce teams, but in today’s climate, there’s a renewed sense of urgency. Data breaches have made regular headlines — permeating every industry from financial services to healthcare to retail.



	These breaches come at a time when businesses of all kinds are looking to find agility and innovate quickly across owned and third-party channels through headless commerce implementations. The added complexity of these implementations can lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed upfront with the right technology, best practices, and partners. 



	Whether you’re just starting out or you’re innovating on top of your current headless implementation, these ecommerce security considerations will help you safeguard data and build trust.

	Every marketer knows that a lot of effort goes into the content process — from researching, creating, and editing to organizing, indexing, and publishing. Fortunately, there’s a useful technology that marketers can use to help manage all of this: a CMS, or content management system. 



	In this article, you’ll learn how a CMS can help marketers efficiently create, publish, and manage content that delivers personalized experiences to audiences at scale and more.



 
    


 
    




            
                What is a Content Management System? 
            
            
            
            
        



	A CMS is a single content hub that allows users to create, edit, organize, publish, and update content digitally — without necessarily needing to code. CMS software makes the content management process easier by introducing visual content editors, drag-and-drop layout tools, and straightforward revision tracking and publishing workflows. 



	In addition to standard content management capabilities, many CMS platforms have more complex features that support indexing, search engine optimization, templates for landing pages and microsites, demand generation strategy, and digital experience creation.



	According to the 7th State of Marketing report from Salesforce, 71% of marketing organizations use content management platforms. Marketers can use a CMS to build a variety of digital experiences for their audiences, including full websites, landing pages, and promotional microsites.








	With a powerful CMS, marketers can create content in one place and easily share it across multiple channels, such as mobile devices, branded apps, or third-party platforms. In addition, content changes can be syndicated across every channel to reduce the need for duplicative edits.





            
                Reasons to use a CMS 
            
            
            
            
        



	A CMS can offer many benefits to an organization, including marketer productivity, brand consistency, and faster launch times for new content and sites. 



	Most CMS platforms come with a variety of pre-designed templates for every possible type of digital campaign, and it’s easy to plug in additional templates to expand content even further. With intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, a CMS makes it simple to build web ads, emails, social posts, and websites — and improve workflows and boost productivity. 



	A CMS effectively eliminates the need for marketers to have complex coding skills. This means that instead of spending time checking lines of code, marketers can jump right into a CMS interface and start bringing their campaign ideas to life. 








	By connecting their CMS with other marketing technology such as a CRM, marketers can also ensure that they’re building relevant content based on customer data and that their brand messaging is consistent across every channel. 





            
                How a CMS works 
            
            
            
            
        



	Within every CMS, there are two key applications that make it work: a CMA and a CDA.




The CMA, or content management application, is what allows marketers and leaders from every line of business to create content of all types without needing to know how to code or call a developer to help.
The CDA, or content delivery application, is the publishing and updating function. Working on the back end of every content publishing channel (such as a website), the CDA allows users to automatically publish new content and scheduled updates without coding or the assistance of developers.






            
                How to choose a CMS 
            
            
            
            
        








	Different CMS platforms come with different functionality. To make sure you’re choosing the right one, consider the following: 





            
                Assess needs 
            
            
            
            
        



	Choosing the best CMS really starts with understanding what your audience wants from your content — and what your business needs to do with that content. Once you know that, you’ll start to narrow down the selection.



	If you need to create an ecommerce site, the right CMS platform could help you build and manage one without writing a single line of code. The same goes for a blog with multiple contributors or organizing different user groups and communities for your audience. A CMS can also help you create standard digital marketing content of all types for publishing on any channel. 



	It’s also important to assess your needs for ease of use, security, and accessibility. While most CMS platforms are very easy to use, include configurable security settings to protect company and customer data and offer accessibility features. This does vary between platforms. The best CMS is the one that’s easiest and safest for everyone on your team to use. 





            
                Understand scale 
            
            
            
            
        



	The content needs of a small- to medium-size business (SMB) are different from the content needs of a major corporation. And B2B companies often have different content needs compared to B2C companies. To choose the best CMS for your business, you need to consider both the current scale of your operation and how you plan to scale your content and campaigns in the future.



	An SMB might always have SMB-sized content needs — but they also might have plans to publish a lot more content as they grow. Conversely, a larger organization may have a massive audience and need every piece of content to be multichannel — or they may sometimes want to reach a smaller audience segment with more specialized content. Whatever your plans are, your CMS needs to be able to accommodate them and grow with you.





            
                Determine budget 
            
            
            
            
        



	Similar to scale, budget is an important consideration that is unique to your organization. A larger, more robust CMS will generally be more expensive, but it can accommodate virtually any possible content need your organization may have.



	On the other hand, you may be surprised at how much you can accomplish with a smaller solution or a portion of a larger CMS platform. Fortunately, there are CMS options to meet every possible budget or use case — whether you’re starting from scratch or replacing an existing system.





            
                Ensure integration 
            
            
            
            
        



	When considering new marketing technology (or martech, for short), it’s crucial to ask whether your new solution is going to work with the rest of your existing tech stack.



	The best CMS is one that automatically works with your CRM system, your customer service tools, your digital experience platform (DXP), your communities, and more. While every CMS offers simple content creation with the option of no code, not every CMS integrates easily with other martech. 





            
                How CMS compares to DXP and WCMS 
            
            
            
            
        



	In digital marketing today, you may have seen CMS platforms mentioned alongside digital experience platforms and web content management systems (WCMS). These three platform types are all different and aren’t quite interchangeable. But they can be used together to create optimal content and experiences for customers.





            
                What is a DXP? 
            
            
            
            
        



	A DXP provides technology that connects experiences; it may also include some content-creation features. It provides the tools marketers need to engage their customers with content (from a CMS) across channels, communities, and front-end digital experiences. It’s meant to be used with other tools, like a CRM or CMS, to bridge the gaps between customers’ digital experiences and facilitate personalization everywhere customers engage.










            
                What is a WCMS? 
            
            
            
            
        



	A WCMS is a CMS that is specifically dedicated to creating and managing content for digital channels and the web only (instead of content for non-digital channels). The digital-first focus of a WCMS benefits businesses that don't need to produce any offline content and instead must prioritize content for digital experiences across connected channels and devices.

In each of these tools, you’ll find intuitive drag-and-drop tools that will enable you to quickly and efficiently create the content and craft the experiences that your customers expect.

Every marketer knows that a lot of effort goes into the content process — from researching, creating, and editing to organizing, indexing, and publishing. Fortunately, there’s a useful technology that marketers can use to help manage all of this: a , or content management system. In this article, you’ll learn how a  can help marketers efficiently create, publish, and manage content that delivers personalized experiences to audiences at scale and more. A  is a single content hub that allows users to create, edit, organize, publish, and update content digitally — without necessarily needing to code. software makes the content management process easier by introducing visual content editors, drag-and-drop layout tools, and straightforward revision tracking and publishing workflows. In addition to standard content management capabilities, many  platforms have more complex features that support indexing, search engine optimization, templates for landing pages and microsites, demand generation strategy, and digital experience creation. According to the 7th State of Marketing report from Salesforce, 71% of marketing organizations use content management platforms. With a powerful , marketers can create content in one place and easily share it across multiple channels, such as mobile devices, branded apps, or third-party platforms. Most  platforms come with a variety of pre-designed templates for every possible type of digital campaign, and it’s easy to plug in additional templates to expand content even further. By connecting their  with other marketing technology such as a , marketers can also ensure that they’re building relevant content based on customer data and that their brand messaging is consistent across every channel. How a  works                                                         	Within every , there are two key applications that make it work: a  and a .The , or content management application, is what allows marketers and leaders from every line of business to create content of all types without needing to know how to code or call a developer to help.The , or content delivery application, is the publishing and updating function. Working on the back end of every content publishing channel (such as a website), the  allows users to automatically publish new content and scheduled updates without coding or the assistance of developers. To make sure you’re choosing the right one, consider the following:                             Assess needs                                                         	Choosing the best  really starts with understanding what your audience wants from your content — and what your business needs to do with that content. Conversely, a larger organization may have a massive audience and need every piece of content to be multichannel — or they may sometimes want to reach a smaller audience segment with more specialized content. Ensure integration                                                         	When considering new marketing technology (or martech, for short), it’s crucial to ask whether your new solution is going to work with the rest of your existing tech stack. The best  is one that automatically works with your  system, your customer service tools, your digital experience platform (), your communities, and more.

Today’s ecommerce website conversion rates are lower than most people realize. In fact, the industry average is currently hovering just under the 5% mark. Given this reality, you should seize every opportunity to optimize your digital strategy, engage shoppers, and ensure their ability to complete purchases quickly and easily.
Good ecommerce website design should be at the top of your list of priorities. When people shop online, often their only experience with your brand is your website. The modern consumer expects a seamless, personalized journey — an effortless path that leads them from initial click to the completion of their purchase. Anything that hinders this shopping experience has the potential to drive clients away. For example, consider that nearly eight in 10 consumers would stop engaging with content that doesn’t display well on their device.








	Good website design ensures that the shopping experience is fast, easy, and as personalized as possible. This is the best way to engage users and boost those all-important conversion rates.





            
                Things to consider when optimizing your ecommerce website design. 
            
            
            
            
        



	How does an ecommerce website designer create seamless, personalized shopping journeys for a wide range of customers? Developers at top ecommerce sites use a number of different methods to make sure that they give shoppers the best experience possible, thereby reducing bounce rates and boosting conversions. Here are a few of the most important things to consider.





            
                Embrace mobile functionality. 
            
            
            
            
        



As more and more shoppers interact with brands on their phones, a huge consideration for your website’s design is making sure that users have the same experience across every channel, on every device. This makes mobile functionality and responsive design essential.
For example, did you know that mobile pages that load one second faster experience up to a 27% increase in conversion rates? As such, optimizing your ecommerce site for mobile is no longer an added bonus or afterthought; it should be your main priority. It is imperative that your site works across every major device and operating system, ensuring that you are not automatically ruling out a large portion of shoppers. A good way to prevent problems across devices is to use a platform that prioritizes responsive design. This saves time on testing and guarantees that your site will function well anytime, anywhere, on any device.
When it comes to designing mobile experiences, it is also important to embrace the latest innovations that respond to today’s consumer demands. For example, one-touch mobile payment option and optimized checkouts have been proven to reduce abandoned carts, giving mobile shoppers fast, easy purchase methods that maximize convenience — and conversion rates.



 
    




 
    




            
                BEST PRACTICES GUIDE 
            
            
            
            
        





            
                Six Ways to Master Mobile-Friendly Site Design 
            
            
            
            
        



To increase conversion rates and ensure growth, you must embrace mobile website design and provide shoppers with a truly mobile-first experience. These six best practices will help.

                Grab a shopper’s attention — and keep it. 
            
            
            
            
        



Writers and ecommerce web developers alike will be familiar with the “inverted pyramid” concept. This is essential in crafting an effective webpage that captures browsing customers and inspires them to pause, consume, and engage with your content. Following the inverted pyramid model, place the most eye-catching important message and desired action at the top, then follow with supporting content and secondary actions. Since most visitors rarely scroll past the first or second message presented to them, it is important to lead with something strong, leaving background details for the bottom of the page. 
How you present your content is as important as the order in which you present it. Most people tend to quickly scan website pages, jumping from headline to image to text, and from page to page. The use of catchy headlines, images that engage directly with both the content and the user, and concise, action-oriented messaging are all great tricks to catch the user’s scanning eye and ensure that your message is read. Be careful not to go overboard — too many images, colors, headlines, and fonts can be as difficult to navigate as no variation at all.





            
                Prioritize your clicks. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Did you know that with every click, you lose a large percentage of your audience? Make sure that the journey to purchase is quick by minimizing the number of steps it takes to find a product and complete a transaction. It is also essential to make sure that your main call to action is featured prominently near the top of the page, with a clear purpose and destination. Try not to drown the page with links and buttons that compete for attention. Use thoughtful design to visually prioritize the clicks that are most important to both you and your customers.





            
                Make it personal. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Many ecommerce sites are not reaching their full conversion potential, but with personalized site content, that doesn’t have to be the case. Personalization puts customers at the heart of your site, allowing you to speak directly with all shoppers and tailor their experiences to every click they make. Personalization techniques include serving up different designs tailored to different target audiences, tailoring search results to each user’s individual shopping behavior, and providing personalized product recommendations through the power of AI. 





            
                Promote conversation. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Personalization extends beyond content. Social media platforms have made it possible for customers to engage with your brand conversationally. This creates a unique opportunity to build personal relationships and inspire brand loyalty and evangelism, provided that you are willing to take advantage of it.

Ensure that all your webpages have easy-to-find links to all your social media platforms, and be sure that your brand’s message is consistent across all channels. When clients reach out to you over social media, don’t let them go unanswered. Show them that you value them as individuals, and respond promptly and politely. Answer questions, address concerns, or even just chat. When shoppers see that your brand is willing to meet them on their turf, they’ll be more willing to do business.





            
                Be informative. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Don’t make the mistake of assuming that your website visitors know everything you know about your products, services, and business. They’re likely encountering your brand for the first time, and they may have only the most basic knowledge going into the experience. First-time users can easily become overwhelmed and will not hesitate to leave your site if they are confused or cannot find the information they need to make confident purchasing decisions. 

Level with them. Take an objective look at who you are and what you are offering, and try to anticipate the questions, objections, and concerns your targeted audience may have. Address these issues directly on your page using clear, concise language, and easy-to-consume formats. Your customers must be able to find what they need to make an intelligent decision without having to expend a lot of effort.





            
                Keep checkout simple. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Not everyone who browses your site and fills an online shopping cart is going to end up completing their transaction. In truth, as many as 77.3% of online retail orders are abandoned prior to purchase. Why is this? While there may be any number of factors in play, the most likely explanation is that the checkout processes themselves are simply too complicated.

User experience is paramount in any retail business, but even more so in ecommerce. Users can abandon their cart, close their browser, or take their shopping elsewhere with no more than a click of a button. If any aspect of your page ends up confusing or slowing them down, you will lose them. 

The solution is to keep it simple. Cut out any unnecessary obstacles. Request only the information you need. Allow buyers to make purchases without having to set up an account. Offer multiple payment options. Make errors easy to fix, without forcing customers to restart the purchase or payment process. 

Shoppers who make it to checkout are nearly at the finish line. Make their last few steps straightforward and easy, and they’ll be much more likely to see it through.





            
                Research trends and embrace innovation. 
            
            
            
            
        



Today’s shopper is connected and tech-savvy, and expects the latest and greatest website experiences from brands — including yours. That said, keeping up with the latest trends is a double-edged sword. 

If you start relying too heavily on trends to drive your site design, you may find yourself scrambling as the latest feature quickly becomes obsolete. For example, website slide features are still a popular aspect on many ecommerce websites, but their effectiveness is in question — a recent study showed that only 1% of all website visitors clicked on a five-feature slider, 89% of whom only clicked on the first image.








	It is just as dangerous to ignore trends altogether, especially if there is evidence to back up their effectiveness. Don’t be afraid to take risks and try new things — just be sure to do your homework. We also recommend testing website design changes to see if your new vision actually resonates with your audience. It is far easier to play with innovations and take design risks when you back them up with informed, data-based insights.





            
                Don’t forget about post-launch. 
            
            
            
            
        



The hard work doesn’t stop once you have a site design that you’re happy with. Both before and after launch, your ecommerce web developers should constantly monitor and update the site to keep things running smoothly. These are just a few of the tasks required:

Regular audits and analysis of your competitors are essential. Review sites, social media, customer experiences, pricing, and market positions regularly to stay up to date with the market.
Regular audits are also important for your own site. For example, don’t forget the importance of SEO audits and functionality reviews. For example, just a one-second delay in page load time can decrease your conversion rate by up to 7%. Make sure that everything is working smoothly and that any problems with functionality are corrected as soon as possible.
You can also use audits to monitor checkout flow and identify the most common places on the site where users stop shopping, bounce from the site, or abandon their carts. There are a lot of tools and programs that can help you track these vital behaviors and inform future design decisions.









	With ecommerce on the rise, it is becoming increasingly important to design a website that can set your brand apart from the crowd. Providing each customer with a seamless, personalized journey that leads them to that final purchase and beyond is one of the best ways to make sure you are doing just that. With Commerce Cloud, you have access to the right tools and analytics needed to craft exactly this kind of exceptional digital journey across every channel and any device, inspiring shoppers and maximizing conversions.

	Average website conversion rates are below 5%, so it’s imperative that your ecommerce website design doesn’t deter potential customers. Having a well-designed website is key to attracting customers, boosting conversion rates, and accurately representing your brand.

Website developers must also establish robust mobile functionality to ensure that customers shopping on mobile devices are able to easily navigate your online shop and make purchases.

In fact, the industry average is currently hovering just under the 5% mark. Given this reality, you should seize every opportunity to optimize your digital strategy, engage shoppers, and ensure their ability to complete purchases quickly and easily.Good ecommerce website design should be at the top of your list of priorities. When people shop online, often their only experience with your brand is your website. The modern consumer expects a seamless, personalized journey — an effortless path that leads them from initial click to the completion of their purchase. Anything that hinders this shopping experience has the potential to drive clients away. For example, consider that nearly eight in 10 consumers would stop engaging with content that doesn’t display well on their device.	Good website design ensures that the shopping experience is fast, easy, and as personalized as possible. This is the best way to engage users and boost those all-important conversion rates.                            Things to consider when optimizing your ecommerce website design.                                                         	How does an ecommerce website designer create seamless, personalized shopping journeys for a wide range of customers? Developers at top ecommerce sites use a number of different methods to make sure that they give shoppers the best experience possible, thereby reducing bounce rates and boosting conversions. Here are a few of the most important things to consider.                            Embrace mobile functionality.                                                         As more and more shoppers interact with brands on their phones, a huge consideration for your website’s design is making sure that users have the same experience across every channel, on every device. This makes mobile functionality and responsive design essential.For example, did you know that mobile pages that load one second faster experience up to a 27% increase in conversion rates? As such, optimizing your ecommerce site for mobile is no longer an added bonus or afterthought; it should be your main priority. It is imperative that your site works across every major device and operating system, ensuring that you are not automatically ruling out a large portion of shoppers. A good way to prevent problems across devices is to use a platform that prioritizes responsive design. This saves time on testing and guarantees that your site will function well anytime, anywhere, on any device.When it comes to designing mobile experiences, it is also important to embrace the latest innovations that respond to today’s consumer demands. For example, one-touch mobile payment option and optimized checkouts have been proven to reduce abandoned carts, giving mobile shoppers fast, easy purchase methods that maximize convenience — and conversion rates.                                                                                                                             Six Ways to Master Mobile-Friendly Site Design                                                         To increase conversion rates and ensure growth, you must embrace mobile website design and provide shoppers with a truly mobile-first experience. These six best practices will help.                                E-                                          Grab a shopper’s attention — and keep it.                                                         Writers and ecommerce web developers alike will be familiar with the “inverted pyramid” concept. This is essential in crafting an effective webpage that captures browsing customers and inspires them to pause, consume, and engage with your content. Following the inverted pyramid model, place the most eye-catching important message and desired action at the top, then follow with supporting content and secondary actions. Since most visitors rarely scroll past the first or second message presented to them, it is important to lead with something strong, leaving background details for the bottom of the page. How you present your content is as important as the order in which you present it. Most people tend to quickly scan website pages, jumping from headline to image to text, and from page to page. The use of catchy headlines, images that engage directly with both the content and the user, and concise, action-oriented messaging are all great tricks to catch the user’s scanning eye and ensure that your message is read. Be careful not to go overboard — too many images, colors, headlines, and fonts can be as difficult to navigate as no variation at all.                            Prioritize your clicks.                                                         	Did you know that with every click, you lose a large percentage of your audience? Make sure that the journey to purchase is quick by minimizing the number of steps it takes to find a product and complete a transaction. It is also essential to make sure that your main call to action is featured prominently near the top of the page, with a clear purpose and destination. Try not to drown the page with links and buttons that compete for attention. Use thoughtful design to visually prioritize the clicks that are most important to both you and your customers.                            Make it personal.                                                         	Many ecommerce sites are not reaching their full conversion potential, but with personalized site content, that doesn’t have to be the case. Personalization puts customers at the heart of your site, allowing you to speak directly with all shoppers and tailor their experiences to every click they make. Personalization techniques include serving up different designs tailored to different target audiences, tailoring search results to each user’s individual shopping behavior, and providing personalized product recommendations through the power of .                             Promote conversation.                                                         	Personalization extends beyond content. Social media platforms have made it possible for customers to engage with your brand conversationally. This creates a unique opportunity to build personal relationships and inspire brand loyalty and evangelism, provided that you are willing to take advantage of it.Ensure that all your webpages have easy-to-find links to all your social media platforms, and be sure that your brand’s message is consistent across all channels. When clients reach out to you over social media, don’t let them go unanswered. Show them that you value them as individuals, and respond promptly and politely. Answer questions, address concerns, or even just chat. When shoppers see that your brand is willing to meet them on their turf, they’ll be more willing to do business.                            Be informative.                                                         	Don’t make the mistake of assuming that your website visitors know everything you know about your products, services, and business. They’re likely encountering your brand for the first time, and they may have only the most basic knowledge going into the experience. First-time users can easily become overwhelmed and will not hesitate to leave your site if they are confused or cannot find the information they need to make confident purchasing decisions. Level with them. Take an objective look at who you are and what you are offering, and try to anticipate the questions, objections, and concerns your targeted audience may have. Address these issues directly on your page using clear, concise language, and easy-to-consume formats. Your customers must be able to find what they need to make an intelligent decision without having to expend a lot of effort.                            Keep checkout simple.                                                         	Not everyone who browses your site and fills an online shopping cart is going to end up completing their transaction. In truth, as many as 77.3% of online retail orders are abandoned prior to purchase. Why is this? While there may be any number of factors in play, the most likely explanation is that the checkout processes themselves are simply too complicated.User experience is paramount in any retail business, but even more so in ecommerce. Users can abandon their cart, close their browser, or take their shopping elsewhere with no more than a click of a button. If any aspect of your page ends up confusing or slowing them down, you will lose them. The solution is to keep it simple. Cut out any unnecessary obstacles. Request only the information you need. Allow buyers to make purchases without having to set up an account. Offer multiple payment options. Make errors easy to fix, without forcing customers to restart the purchase or payment process. Shoppers who make it to checkout are nearly at the finish line. Make their last few steps straightforward and easy, and they’ll be much more likely to see it through.                            Research trends and embrace innovation.                                                         Today’s shopper is connected and tech-savvy, and expects the latest and greatest website experiences from brands — including yours. That said, keeping up with the latest trends is a double-edged sword. If you start relying too heavily on trends to drive your site design, you may find yourself scrambling as the latest feature quickly becomes obsolete. For example, website slide features are still a popular aspect on many ecommerce websites, but their effectiveness is in question — a recent study showed that only 1% of all website visitors clicked on a five-feature slider, 89% of whom only clicked on the first image.	It is just as dangerous to ignore trends altogether, especially if there is evidence to back up their effectiveness. Don’t be afraid to take risks and try new things — just be sure to do your homework. We also recommend testing website design changes to see if your new vision actually resonates with your audience. It is far easier to play with innovations and take design risks when you back them up with informed, data-based insights.                            Don’t forget about post-launch.                                                         The hard work doesn’t stop once you have a site design that you’re happy with. Both before and after launch, your ecommerce web developers should constantly monitor and update the site to keep things running smoothly. These are just a few of the tasks required:Regular audits and analysis of your competitors are essential. Review sites, social media, customer experiences, pricing, and market positions regularly to stay up to date with the market.Regular audits are also important for your own site. For example, don’t forget the importance of  audits and functionality reviews. For example, just a one-second delay in page load time can decrease your conversion rate by up to 7%. Make sure that everything is working smoothly and that any problems with functionality are corrected as soon as possible.You can also use audits to monitor checkout flow and identify the most common places on the site where users stop shopping, bounce from the site, or abandon their carts. There are a lot of tools and programs that can help you track these vital behaviors and inform future design decisions.	With ecommerce on the rise, it is becoming increasingly important to design a website that can set your brand apart from the crowd. Providing each customer with a seamless, personalized journey that leads them to that final purchase and beyond is one of the best ways to make sure you are doing just that. With Commerce Cloud, you have access to the right tools and analytics needed to craft exactly this kind of exceptional digital journey across every channel and any device, inspiring shoppers and maximizing conversions.                                 Amanda DiSilvestro                                                         	Author Bio hidden on all screens.                              Questions?

For example, website slide features are still a popular aspect on many ecommerce websites, but their effectiveness is in question — a recent study showed that only 1% of all website visitors clicked on a five-feature slider, 89% of whom only clicked on the first image. Both before and after launch, your ecommerce web developers should constantly monitor and update the site to keep things running smoothly. Review sites, social media, customer experiences, pricing, and market positions regularly to stay up to date with the market.Regular audits are also important for your own site. Make sure that everything is working smoothly and that any problems with functionality are corrected as soon as possible.You can also use audits to monitor checkout flow and identify the most common places on the site where users stop shopping, bounce from the site, or abandon their carts. With ecommerce on the rise, it is becoming increasingly important to design a website that can set your brand apart from the crowd. Providing each customer with a seamless, personalized journey that leads them to that final purchase and beyond is one of the best ways to make sure you are doing just that. With Commerce Cloud, you have access to the right tools and analytics needed to craft exactly this kind of exceptional digital journey across every channel and any device, inspiring shoppers and maximizing conversions.

                6 Ecommerce Optimization Tips for Boosting Conversions 
            
            
            
            
        































 
    





We’ve come a long way since the mid-'80s, when CompuServe was the world’s first and only ecommerce option available. Today, ecommerce has become an invaluable part of everyday life, with essentially every retail entity — from major corporations on down to local brick-and-mortar shops — having some form of online store. In fact, by the end of 2018, ecommerce sales (B2C) are expected to hit more than $2.3 trillion.
That is a lot of money — and opportunity — for your brand. As such, it is vital that your ecommerce site be perfectly optimized to stand out in the sea of competitors, maximize conversions, and keep customers coming back again and again. To do that, you need to provide the best user experience possible, connecting shoppers to the products they want in the fastest, most effective, and most convenient way.
Here are six ecommerce conversion optimization best practices to help you get started.
 





            
                1. Keep it simple. 
            
            
            
            
        



“Ecommerce optimization” conjures up images of search terms, keywords, and optimized CTA buttons. But first, it’s important to take a step back and make sure that your site is clean, user-friendly, and easy to navigate. Most users are quick to vacate sites that are too busy or over-complicated, and once they bounce you’ll have a hard time getting them to come back.
For example, 54% of ecommerce sites suffer from over-categorization. As an increasing number of people prefer to shop on their mobile devices — where intent-driven micro-moments are reshaping how we view the customer journey — overly complicated or crowded menus can be a hassle more than a help, potentially driving your customers off to look elsewhere. Over-categorization can cause navigation issues that result in customers leaving rather than completing a purchase.





            
                2. Use AI to personalize the shopping experience. 
            
            
            
            
        



More than half of consumers have said that they are likely to switch brands if a company doesn’t personalize its communications with them. This goes beyond email and social media, to onsite shopping recommendations. Use AI-driven tools such as intelligent product recommendations to personalize the shopping experience, giving your customers more of the experience they want, and increasing the chance of conversions.
AI-powered product recommendations not only offer more personalization, but enable a more relevant and efficient experience for your customers. And the evidence is there to back it up — in one case study, Black Diamond saw a 15.5% increase in revenue after implementing AI.

                Implementing AI-Powered Commerce with Einstein

                3. Make sure your onsite search tool is effective. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Another often overlooked tool may be one of the most important — shoppers who use native search functionality convert at a 3x higher rate than those using navigation tools, check out with 11% larger carts, and spend 15% more than those who just browse. Despite this, when searching, 72% of sites don’t suggest highly relevant categories in the auto-complete. For customers, it is a nuisance to be met with an inefficient search function, such as one that results in inaccurate results, crowded results, or no results at all. Bottom line, poor search experiences can result in higher bounce rates and dissatisfied customers. Better search results shorten the amount of time to checkout, and thus increase the likelihood of purchase.








Improve your search feature with language- or location-based search settings, allowances for hypernyms and synonyms, and searches based on audience segmentation. Predictive sort is a tool that incorporates AI and customer data to create personalized search drop-downs, search pages, and even category grid pages.

                4. Set clear paths to purchase. 
            
            
            
            
        



The purpose of a good ecommerce website is to make the end goal — final purchase — all but unavoidable. This means facilitating a clear journey to purchase from every part of the site. Is the purchase CTA button easy to locate and available on every page? Do your customers have to scroll to find it? It should be easily visible from any part of every page, on both desktop and mobile. We also recommend that the purchase CTA always remain in plain sight at the top or side of the page as your customer scrolls.
You must also collaborate on all inbound marketing efforts and ensure that everyone involved is aligned with this goal. For example, if a shopper is coming to your site from a social media post, blog post, or video, be sure that they are on a clear journey to purchase.





            
                5. Optimize the shopping cart and checkout process. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Cart abandonment is always high — in the first quarter of 2017, the global rate was 75.6%. As such, anything you can do to decrease this outcome is crucial. This is another area where mobile ecommerce optimization is paramount — mobile makes up the majority of cart abandonments in most major industries.








	To tackle this problem, try to reduce field options and make them big enough for mobile users to easily see and fill. Also provide autofill options wherever possible, and offer the option for guest checkout — 35% of mobile cart abandonments are a result of shoppers being forced to create an account prior to checkout. Though you want to encourage return customers by creating accounts, it may make a significant difference to your conversions if you present that optional step after purchase, rather than as a requirement before.





            
                6. Provide mobile payment accelerators. 
            
            
            
            
        



	As mentioned, mobile should be a top priority. At the end of 2017, phones accounted for more than 60% of site traffic. Naturally, anything that you can do to optimize the ecommerce experience for mobile is going to boost your conversion rate. Mobile payment accelerators and one-touch payments are a great way to accomplish that all-important goal of decreasing the time to purchase and facilitating journeys. Apple Pay, Android Pay, and PayPal are all major players in helping you to create frictionless online shopping experiences for all of your customers.

For example, if a shopper is coming to your site from a social media post, blog post, or video, be sure that they are on a clear journey to purchase.                            5. Optimize the shopping cart and checkout process.                                                         	Cart abandonment is always high — in the first quarter of 2017, the global rate was 75.6%. As such, anything you can do to decrease this outcome is crucial. This is another area where mobile ecommerce optimization is paramount — mobile makes up the majority of cart abandonments in most major industries.	To tackle this problem, try to reduce field options and make them big enough for mobile users to easily see and fill. Also provide autofill options wherever possible, and offer the option for guest checkout — 35% of mobile cart abandonments are a result of shoppers being forced to create an account prior to checkout. Though you want to encourage return customers by creating accounts, it may make a significant difference to your conversions if you present that optional step after purchase, rather than as a requirement before.                            6. Provide mobile payment accelerators.                                                         	As mentioned, mobile should be a top priority. At the end of 2017, phones accounted for more than 60% of site traffic. Naturally, anything that you can do to optimize the ecommerce experience for mobile is going to boost your conversion rate. Mobile payment accelerators and one-touch payments are a great way to accomplish that all-important goal of decreasing the time to purchase and facilitating journeys. Apple Pay, Android Pay, and PayPal are all major players in helping you to create frictionless online shopping experiences for all of your customers.                                                                                                                             Six Ways to Master Mobile Site Design                                                         To increase conversion rates and ensure growth, you must embrace mobile site design and provide shoppers with a truly mobile-first experience. These six best practices will help.

Today, ecommerce has become an invaluable part of everyday life, with essentially every retail entity — from major corporations on down to local brick-and-mortar shops — having some form of online store. In fact, by the end of 2018, ecommerce sales (B2C) are expected to hit more than $2.3 trillion.That is a lot of money — and opportunity — for your brand. As such, it is vital that your ecommerce site be perfectly optimized to stand out in the sea of competitors, maximize conversions, and keep customers coming back again and again. To do that, you need to provide the best user experience possible, connecting shoppers to the products they want in the fastest, most effective, and most convenient way.Here are six ecommerce conversion optimization best practices to help you get started. “Ecommerce optimization” conjures up images of search terms, keywords, and optimized  buttons. But first, it’s important to take a step back and make sure that your site is clean, user-friendly, and easy to navigate. Most users are quick to vacate sites that are too busy or over-complicated, and once they bounce you’ll have a hard time getting them to come back.For example, 54% of ecommerce sites suffer from over-categorization. As an increasing number of people prefer to shop on their mobile devices — where intent-driven micro-moments are reshaping how we view the customer journey — overly complicated or crowded menus can be a hassle more than a help, potentially driving your customers off to look elsewhere. Use -driven tools such as intelligent product recommendations to personalize the shopping experience, giving your customers more of the experience they want, and increasing the chance of conversions.-powered product recommendations not only offer more personalization, but enable a more relevant and efficient experience for your customers. And the evidence is there to back it up — in one case study, Black Diamond saw a 15.5% increase in revenue after implementing . Another often overlooked tool may be one of the most important — shoppers who use native search functionality convert at a 3x higher rate than those using navigation tools, check out with 11% larger carts, and spend 15% more than those who just browse. Despite this, when searching, 72% of sites don’t suggest highly relevant categories in the auto-complete. For customers, it is a nuisance to be met with an inefficient search function, such as one that results in inaccurate results, crowded results, or no results at all. Bottom line, poor search experiences can result in higher bounce rates and dissatisfied customers. Better search results shorten the amount of time to checkout, and thus increase the likelihood of purchase.Improve your search feature with language- or location-based search settings, allowances for hypernyms and synonyms, and searches based on audience segmentation. Predictive sort is a tool that incorporates  and customer data to create personalized search drop-downs, search pages, and even category grid pages.You can learn more about best onsite search practices here. For example, if a shopper is coming to your site from a social media post, blog post, or video, be sure that they are on a clear journey to purchase.

	Despite the massive shift toward online shopping, there is still a place for brick-and-mortar retail. In fact, as many as 85% of customers still prefer to shop in-store rather than online. However, recent data suggests that trends are changing. Long-established retail stores are often failing to meet projected earnings year after year, while ecommerce sites are moving in to fill the vacuum. According to a report by the U.S. Census Bureau, Q1 2016 retail sales only grew by 2.2% from the previous year, while ecommerce sales have been growing by a yearly average of 15%.








Is the future of retail online? It may be, but there are a number of advantages to in-store shopping that have yet to be duplicated in the digital space, and many reasons why people still prefer to do their shopping in person. For example, consumers enjoy the ability to see, touch, and test out products before committing to them, and often find the gratification of instant ownership more appealing than waiting for items to ship.
The true future of retail is a combination of both online and in-store shopping, experienced seamlessly across multiple channels via whichever method the customer prefers. Thanks to omni-channel retail and the power of unified commerce, businesses are delivering that future to customers today.





            
                What is the difference between omni-channel and unified commerce? 
            
            
            
            
        



Omni-channel retailing describes a model in which clients are able to interact with multiple sales and media channels at once, and have their information retained by the retailer as they move between them. For example, omni-channel retailing allows your clients to browse on a desktop, compare prices on a mobile device, then visit your brick-and-mortar location to finalize a purchase — all without having to restart their customer journey. The omni-channel retailing links together all channels, combining the showroom and the website to create a single, unified experience.
Where omni-channel commerce strives to unify several separate channels, unified commerce takes multichannel selling one step further. Unified commerce relies on cloud technology to integrate all business functions, channels, and client data onto a single platform. Rather than allowing your customers to move seamlessly across multiple channels, you give them the opportunity to stay within a single channel — one that incorporates all other channels and data.
While there are some blurred lines between these two strategies, they both demonstrate that unified selling creates a more customer-centric business model. By eliminating restrictions on how, when, and where a client can shop, customers gain freedom and flexibility, resulting in an unparalleled experience.





            
                Shoppers want a unified experience. 
            
            
            
            
        



Is a consistent customer experience really that important? In a word, yes. Roughly 75% of consumers expect a consistent experience wherever they engage. When they shop in stores, 68% of consumers say it’s absolutely critical or very important that associates understand their personal preferences or needs. Should businesses fail to deliver on this expectation, they risk losing customers. Some 70% of consumers report that technology has made it significantly easier to take their business elsewhere.

Despite the obvious demand for a unified experience, only 28% of B2C companies are available to serve customers on every channel. This becomes an even bigger concern when you consider that 73% of shoppers use multiple channels during their shopping journey. Taken together, these numbers suggest that approximately two-thirds of retailers are failing to effectively cater to the shopping preferences of approximately two-thirds of their audience.








	Omni-channel retail and unified commerce solutions can help your business turn everyone into an engaged, satisfied, loyal customer — you just need the right tools.





            
                A unified platform is the solution. 
            
            
            
            
        



	To earn the loyalty of more customers, you need a single, comprehensive solution that unifies all aspects of commerce with store innovations, distributed inventory management, cross-channel data integration, and a rich set of ecommerce capabilities that encompass mobile, social, and web — all powered by the flexibility and agility of the cloud.

                Provide seamless experiences across every digital channel. 
            
            
            
            
        



Although the modern customer journey is more fluid and flexible than ever before, shoppers still expect a single, seamless shopping experience. A shopper may choose to interact with your brand across multiple digital channels, bouncing between mobile, web, social, and more before completing their purchase. In order to provide a unified experience, your digital commerce tools must extend beyond the basic website and connect not only with each other, but with the customer — anywhere, anytime, on any device.
Tools that track and collate client activity as customers move from channel to channel help ensure that no matter when or how the buyer resumes the conversation, you have the insights needed to help them pick up exactly where they left off. With continuity and consistency across every channel, clients will never have to worry about having to start over at square one.





            
                Unified order management ensures customer satisfaction beyond the sale. 
            
            
            
            
        



	The shopping experience doesn’t end with the purchase. By integrating order management across all channels — online and in-store — you give shoppers the power and flexibility to choose how and when orders are shipped, where they are delivered, and how they might be returned. Customers can buy online and pick up in-store, purchase in-store and have items shipped, change orders after they’ve been placed, choose between multiple pickup and delivery options, and return items to any location without the usual hassles.





            
                Know your shoppers before they even enter the store. 
            
            
            
            
        



	A truly unified commerce platform allows you to optimize your in-store sales approach with cross-channel customer insights. With a single view of customer activity across digital, social, and more, sales associates can offer personalized, data-based service tailored to each shopper. They can identify a customer’s shopping habits, provide personalized recommendations, and access inventory from any location — including online — to help shoppers find exactly what they’re looking for.





            
                The right solution brings it all together. 
            
            
            
            
        



The commerce world is shifting, but maybe not in the way that some expect. The future of shopping won’t be retail or online, but a hybrid of both. Omni-channel retail and unified commerce brings everything together in a customer-centric, unified solution. This approach will improve the customer experience regardless of how they choose to shop, and increase your effectiveness across all channels. With the right tools, your customers will be able to enjoy a seamless, personalized, interactive buying experience — whether or not they ever set foot in your store.

In fact, as many as 85% of customers still prefer to shop in-store rather than online. However, recent data suggests that trends are changing. Long-established retail stores are often failing to meet projected earnings year after year, while ecommerce sites are moving in to fill the vacuum. According to a report by the U.S. Census Bureau, Q1 2016 retail sales only grew by 2.2% from the previous year, while ecommerce sales have been growing by a yearly average of 15%.Is the future of retail online? It may be, but there are a number of advantages to in-store shopping that have yet to be duplicated in the digital space, and many reasons why people still prefer to do their shopping in person. For example, consumers enjoy the ability to see, touch, and test out products before committing to them, and often find the gratification of instant ownership more appealing than waiting for items to ship.The true future of retail is a combination of both online and in-store shopping, experienced seamlessly across multiple channels via whichever method the customer prefers. Thanks to omni-channel retail and the power of unified commerce, businesses are delivering that future to customers today.                            What is the difference between omni-channel and unified commerce?                                                         Omni-channel retailing describes a model in which clients are able to interact with multiple sales and media channels at once, and have their information retained by the retailer as they move between them. For example, omni-channel retailing allows your clients to browse on a desktop, compare prices on a mobile device, then visit your brick-and-mortar location to finalize a purchase — all without having to restart their customer journey. The omni-channel retailing links together all channels, combining the showroom and the website to create a single, unified experience.Where omni-channel commerce strives to unify several separate channels, unified commerce takes multichannel selling one step further. Unified commerce relies on cloud technology to integrate all business functions, channels, and client data onto a single platform. Rather than allowing your customers to move seamlessly across multiple channels, you give them the opportunity to stay within a single channel — one that incorporates all other channels and data.While there are some blurred lines between these two strategies, they both demonstrate that unified selling creates a more customer-centric business model. By eliminating restrictions on how, when, and where a client can shop, customers gain freedom and flexibility, resulting in an unparalleled experience.                            Shoppers want a unified experience.                                                         Is a consistent customer experience really that important? In a word, yes. Roughly 75% of consumers expect a consistent experience wherever they engage. When they shop in stores, 68% of consumers say it’s absolutely critical or very important that associates understand their personal preferences or needs. Should businesses fail to deliver on this expectation, they risk losing customers. Some 70% of consumers report that technology has made it significantly easier to take their business elsewhere.Despite the obvious demand for a unified experience, only 28% of B2C companies are available to serve customers on every channel. This becomes an even bigger concern when you consider that 73% of shoppers use multiple channels during their shopping journey. Taken together, these numbers suggest that approximately two-thirds of retailers are failing to effectively cater to the shopping preferences of approximately two-thirds of their audience.	Omni-channel retail and unified commerce solutions can help your business turn everyone into an engaged, satisfied, loyal customer — you just need the right tools.                            A unified platform is the solution.                                                         	To earn the loyalty of more customers, you need a single, comprehensive solution that unifies all aspects of commerce with store innovations, distributed inventory management, cross-channel data integration, and a rich set of ecommerce capabilities that encompass mobile, social, and web — all powered by the flexibility and agility of the cloud.                                      When Every Touchpoint is a Transaction                                                         Today’s connected customer wants to shop from any device, any location, any time. Learn how embrace this new retail reality, evolve your approach, and reach more shoppers.                                                                          Provide seamless experiences across every digital channel.                                                         Although the modern customer journey is more fluid and flexible than ever before, shoppers still expect a single, seamless shopping experience. A shopper may choose to interact with your brand across multiple digital channels, bouncing between mobile, web, social, and more before completing their purchase. In order to provide a unified experience, your digital commerce tools must extend beyond the basic website and connect not only with each other, but with the customer — anywhere, anytime, on any device.Tools that track and collate client activity as customers move from channel to channel help ensure that no matter when or how the buyer resumes the conversation, you have the insights needed to help them pick up exactly where they left off. With continuity and consistency across every channel, clients will never have to worry about having to start over at square one.                            Unified order management ensures customer satisfaction beyond the sale.                                                         	The shopping experience doesn’t end with the purchase. By integrating order management across all channels — online and in-store — you give shoppers the power and flexibility to choose how and when orders are shipped, where they are delivered, and how they might be returned. Customers can buy online and pick up in-store, purchase in-store and have items shipped, change orders after they’ve been placed, choose between multiple pickup and delivery options, and return items to any location without the usual hassles.                            Know your shoppers before they even enter the store.                                                         	A truly unified commerce platform allows you to optimize your in-store sales approach with cross-channel customer insights. With a single view of customer activity across digital, social, and more, sales associates can offer personalized, data-based service tailored to each shopper. They can identify a customer’s shopping habits, provide personalized recommendations, and access inventory from any location — including online — to help shoppers find exactly what they’re looking for.                            The right solution brings it all together.                                                         The commerce world is shifting, but maybe not in the way that some expect. The future of shopping won’t be retail or online, but a hybrid of both. Omni-channel retail and unified commerce brings everything together in a customer-centric, unified solution. This approach will improve the customer experience regardless of how they choose to shop, and increase your effectiveness across all channels. With the right tools, your customers will be able to enjoy a seamless, personalized, interactive buying experience — whether or not they ever set foot in your store.

In this report, data from 150+ million shoppers and 250+ million visits to retail sites reveal the true impact of personalization on revenue and growth. The results are eye-opening, and reveal that personalized shopping experiences are not only crucial to your brand’s success, they will separate the winners from the laggards.





Preview the report below:
Ask someone how they shop today, and you’ll encounter nuances and technologies that were barely on our radar ten years ago. From AI-powered product recommendations to receiving deliveries in less than an hour, shopping is being disrupted to an unprecedented extent.
With increasingly mobile and multi-tasking shoppers navigating enormous product catalogs, retailers need to be ready with personalized content and intelligent recommendations. They must show shoppers exactly what they want to see, efficiently and in real time. They also must consider how to leverage the power of AI to anticipate their customers’ next moves.
That’s why personalized shopping is the future of commerce — and the only way to compete amidst consumers’ expanding expectations. Looking for proof? This report analyzes the shopping activity of more than 150 million shoppers and their 250 million visits to retail sites (including $550 million worth of orders and 320 million shopper clicks). We’ll closely analyze this data as it relates to personalized product recommendations, and how these recommendations impact conversion rate, average order value, per-visit spend, and more. This report also includes stories from retail trailblazers driving their businesses with AI-based personalization, and a collection of successful personalization tactics that you can implement yourself—without an army of data scientists.
Get ready to uncover the potential of using AI to capitalize on moments that matter.

	Product recommendations help shoppers find exactly what they are looking for, whether that’s groceries for the week or gear for an upcoming hiking trip. Retailers use product recommendation engines to find items customers will love based on what they type into search fields, click on, favorite, and add to their wish lists or carts. This helps to drive revenue and boost conversion.

	But offering product recommendations is just the first step. Brands can stand out from their competitors by deploying advanced techniques that take product recommendations to the next level.



	The most sophisticated product recommendation engines generate suggestions through machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Customer behavior data gleaned from browser history, search history, viewed items, preferences, and more flow through complex algorithms. These algorithms surface individualized product offerings to each shopper as they browse in-app, on-site, or in future marketing communications.



	Here are eight savvy ways to make the most of product recommendation engines and show shoppers exactly what they need.




Use machine learning technology
Automate your product recommendations system
Integrate your product recommendation engine with your CRM
Highlight your top-selling products
Showcase discounts and special offers
Build new customer experiences with a headless architecture
Capitalize on current trends
Personalize search and category page results

                Product recommendation example #1: Use machine learning technology 
            
            
            
            
        



	Machine learning allows predictive software to use the data it gathers to provide AI-driven product recommendations. As more information is incorporated into the algorithm, the accuracy of the recommendations improves and evolves.



	Most product recommendation engines run on predictive analytics, which make sense of disparate customer data inputs to predict future behaviors. Once this data is analyzed and “trains” the software’s algorithm, it can begin matching customers to the products they’re most likely to buy.





            
                Product recommendation example #2: Automate your product recommendations system 
            
            
            
            
        



	Automation is a key feature of product recommendation engines. It allows brands to easily scale their personalized recommendation efforts. Effective product recommendation engines automate nearly the entire process by collecting data, analyzing it, and delivering recommendations directly to customers. The less often a marketer or merchandiser has to manually step in, the more businesses save time, effort, and money.

Effective suggested selling depends heavily on an accurate analysis of customer data. That’s why it’s important for your product recommendation engine to integrate with your existing customer relationship management (CRM) platform.
Your product recommendations should be based on all available customer data, including goals and important life events. The ability to automate tasks, including tracking, analysis, and reporting, ensures that customers are always guided along the path to brand advocacy.





            
                Product recommendation example #4: Highlight your top-selling products 
            
            
            
            
        



Multiple studies have found that roughly 80% of a company’s profits come from 20% of the products sold. Review past data to identify your best-selling products and continuously showcase these products to potential buyers. That way, you are always surfacing the items that are most likely to result in a sale.
Recommend your top-selling products as people search your website, add items to their carts, or interact with your marketing content.










            
                Product recommendation example #5: Showcase discounts and special offers 
            
            
            
            
        



	Sales and discounts are an easy way to draw people in and spur an influx of sales, both on discounted items and regularly priced items. Use product recommendation software to hook users who are searching for a sweet deal. A promotion or discount might sway those shoppers who are on the fence and direct them to items they might not have bought otherwise.





            
                Product recommendation example #6: Build new customer experiences with a headless architecture 
            
            
            
            
        



Headless commerce separates the front end and back end of an ecommerce application to give brands more freedom in their architecture. With an AI-powered headless commerce architecture, you’re able to bring commerce to – and collect information from – wherever customers engage. A system with flexible application programming interfaces (APIs) makes it possible to embed AI in mobile apps, clienteling tools, and more. With access to more customer data, your product recommendation engines provide more powerful insights. For example, you can use customers’ past purchasing behavior to offer tailored suggestions across digital platforms. Ultimately, you offer a cohesive and personalized shopping experience across all possible touchpoints.










            
                Product recommendation example #7: Capitalize on current trends 
            
            
            
            
        



	When your brand offers a popular item, you’re likely to see a surge of web traffic from customers searching for it. Let’s say that you sell a newly released version of a mobile device. Shoppers also need phone accessories like cases, screen protectors, and back ring holders. You can capitalize on these trends by highlighting the additional products shoppers would likely be interested in. “Complete the set” functionality lets you organize product groupings, such as a head-to-toe outfit, or everything one needs to go camping. Then, when a customer seeks out one of the products, you can show them everything in the set in case they’d like those additional items, too.





            
                Product recommendation example #8: Personalize search and category page results 
            
            
            
            
        



Predictive sort technology uses customer data to deliver tailored results to shoppers searching for products on your website. With the help of AI, you can effectively offer personalized product suggestions for the search drop down, search pages, and category pages.
This technology interweaves personalized product suggestions throughout the shopper journey. The result: Shoppers find exactly what they’re looking for, fast. Customers spend less time searching for the products they want and conversion increases.

","8 Examples of Advanced Product Recommendation Techniques - Salesforce.comSkip to content                                                                                                                                                                                                       8 Examples of Advanced Product Recommendation Techniques That Drive Growth                                                                                     Use artificial intelligence () and other technology to connect shoppers to products they’ll love.                                                                                          June 6, 2021.  5                                                           	Product recommendations help shoppers find exactly what they are looking for, whether that’s groceries for the week or gear for an upcoming hiking trip. Retailers use product recommendation engines to find items customers will love based on what they type into search fields, click on, favorite, and add to their wish lists or carts. This helps to drive revenue and boost conversion.                                      Discover what product recommendation engines are and how they work                                                                                       Learn more                                        	But offering product recommendations is just the first step. Brands can stand out from their competitors by deploying advanced techniques that take product recommendations to the next level.	The most sophisticated product recommendation engines generate suggestions through machine learning and artificial intelligence (). Customer behavior data gleaned from browser history, search history, viewed items, preferences, and more flow through complex algorithms. These algorithms surface individualized product offerings to each shopper as they browse in-app, on-site, or in future marketing communications.	Here are eight savvy ways to make the most of product recommendation engines and show shoppers exactly what they need.Use machine learning technologyAutomate your product recommendations systemIntegrate your product recommendation engine with your ighlight your top-selling productsShowcase discounts and special offersBuild new customer experiences with a headless architectureCapitalize on current trendsPersonalize search and category page results                                 Related Content                                                                                     Article                                                                                     What Is a Retail Product Recommendation Engine – And Why Do You Need One?                                                                                     Article                                                                                     -Driven Product Recommendations — No Data Scientist Required                                                                                     Blog                                                                                     How to Uplevel Smart Merchandising                                                                                               Product recommendation example #1: Use machine learning technology                                                         	Machine learning allows predictive software to use the data it gathers to provide -driven product recommendations. As more information is incorporated into the algorithm, the accuracy of the recommendations improves and evolves.	Most product recommendation engines run on predictive analytics, which make sense of disparate customer data inputs to predict future behaviors. Once this data is analyzed and “trains” the software’s algorithm, it can begin matching customers to the products they’re most likely to buy.                            Product recommendation example #2: Automate your product recommendations system                                                         	Automation is a key feature of product recommendation engines. It allows brands to easily scale their personalized recommendation efforts. Effective product recommendation engines automate nearly the entire process by collecting data, analyzing it, and delivering recommendations directly to customers. The less often a marketer or merchandiser has to manually step in, the more businesses save time, effort, and money.                            Product recommendation example #3: Integrate your product recommendation engine with your                                                          Effective suggested selling depends heavily on an accurate analysis of customer data. That’s why it’s important for your product recommendation engine to integrate with your existing customer relationship management () platform.Your product recommendations should be based on all available customer data, including goals and important life events. The ability to automate tasks, including tracking, analysis, and reporting, ensures that customers are always guided along the path to brand advocacy.                            Product recommendation example #4: Highlight your top-selling products                                                         Multiple studies have found that roughly 80% of a company’s profits come from 20% of the products sold. Review past data to identify your best-selling products and continuously showcase these products to potential buyers. That way, you are always surfacing the items that are most likely to result in a sale.Recommend your top-selling products as people search your website, add items to their carts, or interact with your marketing content.                            Product recommendation example #5: Showcase discounts and special offers                                                         	Sales and discounts are an easy way to draw people in and spur an influx of sales, both on discounted items and regularly priced items. Use product recommendation software to hook users who are searching for a sweet deal. A promotion or discount might sway those shoppers who are on the fence and direct them to items they might not have bought otherwise.                            Product recommendation example #6: Build new customer experiences with a headless architecture                                                         Headless commerce separates the front end and back end of an ecommerce application to give brands more freedom in their architecture. With an -powered headless commerce architecture, you’re able to bring commerce to – and collect information from – wherever customers engage. A system with flexible application programming interfaces (s) makes it possible to embed  in mobile apps, clienteling tools, and more. With access to more customer data, your product recommendation engines provide more powerful insights.

Let’s say that you sell a newly released version of a mobile device. Shoppers also need phone accessories like cases, screen protectors, and back ring holders. You can capitalize on these trends by highlighting the additional products shoppers would likely be interested in. “Complete the set” functionality lets you organize product groupings, such as a head-to-toe outfit, or everything one needs to go camping. Then, when a customer seeks out one of the products, you can show them everything in the set in case they’d like those additional items, too.

Retailers use product recommendation engines to find items customers will love based on what they type into search fields, click on, favorite, and add to their wish lists or carts. Here are eight savvy ways to make the most of product recommendation engines and show shoppers exactly what they need.Use machine learning technologyAutomate your product recommendations systemIntegrate your product recommendation engine with your ighlight your top-selling productsShowcase discounts and special offersBuild new customer experiences with a headless architectureCapitalize on current trendsPersonalize search and category page results                                 Related Content                                                                                     Article                                                                                     What Is a Retail Product Recommendation Engine – And Why Do You Need One?

Most product recommendation engines run on predictive analytics, which make sense of disparate customer data inputs to predict future behaviors. Once this data is analyzed and “trains” the software’s algorithm, it can begin matching customers to the products they’re most likely to buy. Effective product recommendation engines automate nearly the entire process by collecting data, analyzing it, and delivering recommendations directly to customers. That’s why it’s important for your product recommendation engine to integrate with your existing customer relationship management () platform.Your product recommendations should be based on all available customer data, including goals and important life events. That way, you are always surfacing the items that are most likely to result in a sale.Recommend your top-selling products as people search your website, add items to their carts, or interact with your marketing content. Product recommendation example #5: Showcase discounts and special offers                                                         	Sales and discounts are an easy way to draw people in and spur an influx of sales, both on discounted items and regularly priced items. With access to more customer data, your product recommendation engines provide more powerful insights. Product recommendation example #7: Capitalize on current trends                                                         	When your brand offers a popular item, you’re likely to see a surge of web traffic from customers searching for it. Then, when a customer seeks out one of the products, you can show them everything in the set in case they’d like those additional items, too.

                    What is unified commerce?
                





	Where omni-channel commerce strives to unify several separate channels, unified commerce takes multichannel selling one step further. Unified commerce relies on cloud technology to integrate all business functions, channels, and client data onto a single platform. Rather than allowing your customers to move seamlessly across multiple channels, you give them the opportunity to stay within a single channel — one that incorporates all other channels and data.

While there are some blurred lines between these two strategies, they both demonstrate that unified selling creates a more customer-centric business model. By eliminating restrictions on how, when, and where a client can shop, customers gain freedom and flexibility, resulting in an unparalleled experience.










                    How does Commerce Cloud power unified consumer experiences?
                





	Commerce Cloud connects the full customer experience across all touchpoints, enabling a single, shared view of customer activity, inventory, products, and promotions. By connecting all channels — both digital and physical — Commerce Cloud enables brands to provide a truly cohesive experience from discovery to delivery, and beyond.










                    Why are brands using Commerce Cloud to be more agile?
                





	Today's leading brands are moving away from homegrown or legacy on-premises commerce systems because they are difficult to maintain and manage. Brands can take better advantage of opportunities with greater agility using Salesforce’s unified, cloud-based commerce technology and the “single version of truth” that cuts down on the time needed to synchronize disparate data sources.










                    Why are retailers using Commerce Cloud to be more innovative?
                





	Today's connected customer has high expectations. They interact with retail brands through many touchpoints — web, mobile, social, marketplaces, store, ads, and connected devices — and they want to buy in the moment, at any of these touchpoints. They expect each interaction to run smoothly, and for all interactions to be coordinated into a single, unified experience. Brands can also create more highly differentiated experiences for their customers using Salesforce’s open innovation model and by taking advantage of Commerce Cloud’s built-in intelligence to power personalization throughout the commerce experience.










                    What tools are available in Commerce Cloud to help retailers connect consumers to the right products?
                





	Commerce Cloud provides a rich set of capabilities to engage and convert shoppers across every digital channel, including marketing, merchandising, content, promotions, customer service, fulfillment, and predictive intelligence. An open development environment enables retailers to easily customize or extend commerce anywhere, from buy buttons and branded mobile applications to in-store endless aisle and clienteling applications.










                    What is Salesforce Order Management?
                





	Salesforce Order Management is a customer-first order management solution built on the #1 CRM that empowers merchants to fulfill, manage, and service orders at scale.










                    What marketing tools are available to retailers to help engage and convert shoppers?
                





Commerce Cloud is the only commerce solution with Einstein, next-generation artificial intelligence embedded into the very fabric of the platform. With Einstein, brands can deliver delightful, personalized shopping experiences across all channels — no data scientist required. You can: 

Recommend the best products at every touchpoint
Generate 1:1 predictions for every single shopper in real time
Get smart and boost conversions with data-driven commerce insights
Save time and effort with automated merchandising tasks











                    In what ways does Commerce Cloud drive personalized experiences on websites?
                





	With cloud-based multisite management and localization, going live with new brands or geographic sites has never been faster. With our multisite architecture, retailers can manage multiple brands or country sites all from the same environment, leveraging common code, processes, imagery, and a master catalog.










                    How does Commerce Cloud support multi-brand and multisite implementations? 
                





Anyone can browse and explore AppExchange demos and test drives. Salesforce administrators and users with the “Download AppExchange packages” permission can install AppExchange apps.

      How the Tableau sales team uses Tableau during the pandemic
      
The Tableau sales team needed to understand what deals in its pipeline were at risk because of the epidemic. Leaders asked account teams to put the name “COVID” as a prefix in CRM opportunity names facing challenges, improving the tracking of potential impacts of the crisis on specific deals and segments.












          Watch: See how Tableau analyzed its pipeline
         

        By creating a calculated field flagging the deals at risk, Tableau was able to isolate the potential impact of the crisis. They were then able to improve their forecast. This video shows how Tableau's sales team did it.

Verizon uses Tableau COVID-19 Data Hub to amplify dashboards that enhance customer service during the pandemic



Created COVID-19 impact dashboards with heat maps to identify geographic areas requiring service


Used location-based analytics from Tableau dashboards to monitor service pressure related to device, voice, and data connectivity


Adapted dashboards with COVID-19 data to see spikes in service demand relative to pre-pandemic levels














 Share






























Verizon uses multiple Tableau dashboards to manage and optimize its day-to-day customer service operations. State-of-the-art analytics and easy connectivity to a variety of data sources have helped Verizon produce a culture of excellence that anticipates and addresses customer needs across multiple touch points, including call center activities, customer contact via web apps and other digital channels, and even technicians' interactions with customers while out in the field.
Maintaining customer service quality became more vital than ever with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers put increased demand on Verizon's networks. During April 2020 alone, customers placed more than 800 million calls per day—double the amount at the highest peak during a typical year. Calls were an average of one-third longer, text messages spiked to 9 billion daily, gaming on the network was up by 100%, and the number of people using virtual private network (VPN) connections to do their job went up by more than 50%. These increases, combined with Verizon's own priority of keeping its work environment safe for employees, drove the customer service organization to brainstorm new ways of meeting customer needs using available resources.
The team adapted their dashboards to incorporate data from the Tableau COVID-19 Data Hub, enabling them to see spikes in service demand relative to pre-COVID median levels, and adjust resources accordingly. It also helped them understand how their call data can inform them about spikes in network issues. In addition, they created new COVID-19 impact dashboards like the Call Driver Outlier and Anomaly Detection System, which helped them understand how the landscape was changing post-pandemic with respect to customers' calling behavior. The team built innovative prototypes showing heat maps of call center and technician dispatch activities, helping to identify geographic areas requiring service so the Verizon workforce could make intentional decisions about how to respond.









The pandemic has accelerated digital transformation exponentially. 5-year roadmaps are compressed into six months. Getting insights from our Tableau dashboards in near-real time puts us in a better position to serve our customers during the crisis.


          Siddharth Dayama, 
Senior Manager of Data Analytics and Customer Service Operations










Key to some of these activities was the Tableau COVID-19 Data Hub web data connector. “Using the web data connector, we blended Johns Hopkins University's pandemic data with our own internal customer service operations data,” explains Siddharth Dayama, Senior Manager of Data Analytics and Customer Service Operations. “This helped us correlate location-based spikes in service demand with COVID-19 hotspots around the country. This ability to seamlessly bridge insights from external world macro factors to our company's internal operational metrics is a game changer and helps us better understand the impact and make informed decisions.”
Amid all this change, Verizon also retrained more than 20,000 retail store operators and other call center customer service employees to continue their duties from workstations in their own homes, with access to all the same dashboards and other tools needed to perform in their roles, as part of the company's home-based work platform.
“Personally, I am very proud of our response capacity throughout this crisis,” said Dayama. “Verizon's networks withstood the additional pressure, and the company retained and retrained their professional workers—all while continuing on the mission to help customers stay connected during a difficult time.”
The flexibility and extensibility of Verizon's Tableau platform also helped with business continuity by enabling daily reporting across departments. “The beauty of dashboards versus static reporting is that the data IS the content, so when the data changes, the content is updated automatically, showing the latest trends,” Dayama explained. “And Tableau is built for 'learning by doing'—so when COVID-19 hit and we had new challenges to solve for, we could jump right in to start creating and modifying dashboards that met those needs.”

            Tableau Case Study: Using Analytics During a Pandemic
          











      An interactive, internal case study
      

Like our customers, Tableau employees, managers, and leaders find themselves in a dramatically altered business world. COVID-19 is impacting every part of our business, from where we work to the way we measure success. In these challenging times, analytics have been critical to helping us make decisions confidently and quickly. While the dashboards shared below have been simplified—and the data has been randomized and made completely anonymous—the use cases are real. Our hope is that the resources presented here enable you to do more with your data during this time and assist your plans for recovery.

      Sales: Reducing uncertainty in a crisis
      
The Tableau sales team needed to understand what deals in its pipeline were at risk because of the epidemic. Leaders asked account teams to put the name “COVID” as a prefix in CRM opportunity names facing challenges, improving the tracking of potential impacts of the crisis on specific deals and segments.












          Watch: See how Tableau analyzed its pipeline
         

        By creating a calculated field flagging the deals at risk, Tableau was able to isolate the potential impact of the crisis. They were then able to improve their forecast. This video shows how Tableau's sales team did it.

      Human resources: Ensuring employee safety and success
      
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced human resources departments to ask new questions around employee safety and working from home. The Tableau people analytics team used data to inform their response: They enriched their data with publicly available information and by gathering new data from an employee survey.












          Employee Safety Dashboard
         

        Tableau’s executives were interested in monitoring local conditions and proactively guiding employees to work from home in epidemic hotspots. We used the power of Tableau Prep Builder to join Workday data file with COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins. This dashboard provides daily updates that will help inform executives around when it’s safe to return to work. Learn more:

      Marketing: Understanding new digital initiatives
      
As the COVID-19 pandemic keeps the world stuck inside, marketing teams across the world have increasingly turned to new digital initiatives to reach their customers. Tableau has done the same by launching the COVID-19 Data Hub. The web site hosts a collection resources and visualizations to help people make sense of COVID-19 data. The Tableau marketing team needed to understand how the page has been gaining traction and how to improve the page with updates to the content.












          Website KPI Dashboard
         

        The dashboard tracks the key performance indicators of Tableau's new web site. The KPI dashboard is posted to our internal Tableau Server, where executives can subscribe via email, comment or dive into the data source themselves to answer follow up questions. Learn more:

      Customer support: Launching a new program
      
As the pandemic began to spread, Tableau account reps, customer success, and support staff saw a surge of customers asking for help with problems they had never anticipated. With the large volume of requests, Tableau decided to create a new process to address these COVID-specific concerns, tracking the number of requests, their statuses, the employees resolving them, and more, to optimize the workflow and solutions being offered.












          Customer Request Management
         

        Tableau stood up an entirely new program outside normal customer support channels. To do so, they created a intake form which enabled them to collect standardized data. They used a dashboard like this one to manage those requests. It's possible to see the oldest tickets open and contact the people assigned. Or, users can view all the tickets open in a a specific segment.

          Volunteer Staffing Assignment
         

        When employees heard they could help customer with needs tied to the pandemic, volunteers joined a slack channel to see what they could do. This dashboard shows the slack channel’s membership enriched with details about each member’s background. It's particularly useful at identifying volunteers with skill sets in regions where staffing is challenging.

          COVID-19 Work Tracking
         

        This dashboard shows the amount of time our teams spend working on requests by account and by employee.  Hovering reveals details about the request and the nature of the work in the tool tips. Understanding how employees are spending their time helps managers on the customer success team manage their resources more effectively.

Preparing data and sharing dashboards

Tableau is using Tableau Prep Builder to create a clean Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 data stream that combines WHO and CDC case data. In addition to making that clean and up-to-date data available to you, we used Tableau Desktop to build a global coronavirus tracking dashboard and a COVID-19 Starter Workbook to help you start blending your own data.

            Four Service Analytics Strategies
          

            How to transform your service organization with data
          











Support and Service Analytics Strategies 

Introduction: A new era of service leadership

Digital transformation demands an entirely new set of skills from today’s service leaders. Yesterday’s customer support organizations needed leaders capable of motivating their call center teams while driving efficient operations. Today’s customer support organizations leaders must deliver on that same goal, but also be capable of creating a vision of how their company differentiates itself through customer experience. Leaders must then back up that vision with investments that enable their organization to follow through and earn loyal customers. One of the critical investments to realize your vision for better customer experience must be in analytics. In the age of digital transformation, when data is exploding and service organizations deliver on more channels than ever, it is impossible to create a service organization offering efficient, high quality customer service without deep insights into customers and your business. The opportunity that lies in customer service data is too obvious to ignore, but almost too overwhelming to fully quantify. Where should you start and what should you prioritize? Here are four strategies to transform your service organization with analytics:


Continuously improve every customer touchpoint
Align your service metrics to your vision
Enable career growth in service
Turn customer service into everyone’s responsibility

In this interactive whitepaper, we will share field-test use cases from Tableau customers that align to those strategies, and provide resources that will help your analytics team get started. By identifying your greatest service analytics opportunities, we hope that you’ll be able to deliver the customer experiences that differentiate your company and earn you customers for life.












      Continuously improve every customer touchpoint
      



The average customer service team uses nine channels to help its customers, according to a Salesforce Study. While some customers still default to calling, many others prefer self-service channels like chatbots, community forums, and knowledge-base articles. A phone call is increasingly a last resort. 
As a result of this ongoing digital transformation, service teams need to be able to look at data from every touchpoint to understand customer service performance. Exploring data from web site activity, social media posts, survey ratings, product usage, purchase history, and training activity can be just as important as tracking customer service case records themselves.












Here are three companies that are looking at data from across their customer journeys and prioritizing improvements that resolve cases more efficiently or avoid them altogether.












Case Study


          Verizon optimizes self-service support with chatbots
         

        Verizon, an American telecommunications with more than 100 million customers, released a Fios on Facebook Messenger chatbot to support stronger customer engagements in 2017. The team uses analytics to track the category of questions that customers ask the bot. The extracted information was used to train the bot's intelligence so it recognizes more questions and responds appropriately to solve issues. They also learned the most popular times for customer engagement and increased staff to handle high-volume service events like power outages or pay-per-view sporting events on Fios TV. Check out Verizon's overview of their service analytics at TC 18 and their deep-dive on speech analytics at TC 19. Or click below to read the case study.

Case Study


          Charles Schwab unlocks automated phone technology
         

        Charles Schwab, one of the largest U.S. financial services firms, takes tens of thousands of calls each day to its contact center. What callers say in Schwab’s interactive voice response (IVR) technology, the automated phone system, had been a black box for some time. After collecting data from the IVR to understand where calls came from, what path customers followed in voice prompts to speak with a representative, who made contact with customers, and the outcome, they visualized all the data in a network diagram This helped Schwab improve its data quality and changed the way they focus on customers to enhance their Schwab experience.

Case Study


          Southwest continuously improves call centers
         

        Southwest Airlines has seven reservation centers that handle customer requests and inquiries. By consolidating data stored in Microsoft SQL Server and Teradata along with survey data stored in Microsoft Access and Excel, Southwest was able to create a universal view of call behavior. In addition to providing real-time feedback on team performance, Southwest was also able to spot that process changes were impacting call volumes on their teams and make changes necessary to prevent problems. Now the team is able to focus on continuous improvement, a process they shared in their TC presentation.

Insights from our dashboards help us optimize call center operations to reduce the need for customers to call us multiple times. Monitoring these timely dashboards shows us that as the resolution rate and satisfaction index of customers go up, volumes for calls and dispatches—which are key cost drivers—go down.


          Sid Dayama, 
Senior Manager of Data Analytics













      Align your service metrics to your vision
      
To transform your service organization, it’s essential to communicate a vision and tie that vision back to specific metrics. That’s often the easy part. Enabling your teams to act on improving those metrics often requires change management. Here are two stories that share how service leaders have prioritized customer experience and enabled their teams to follow through with analytics to make their metrics actionable.












          PEMCO Insurance: Shifting mindsets in the claims department
         

        PEMCO Insurance is a personal-lines mutual insurance company based in Seattle. As the team described in their TC presentation, the company’s claims VP set a strategy “to not be be constrained by the past, but instead to focus on what we want to build for the future.” After assembling a team of key players, PEMCO’s team undertook a change management program. By combining industry expertise, business acumen, and analytical talent, the company enabled more efficient claims handling, leading to higher customer satisfaction and a boost to overall business performance.

          Ochsner Health System: Making every interaction count
         

        The EVP of Operations at Ochsner Health System, Louisiana's largest non-profit, academic, healthcare system, set a mandate: Make every interaction count. The analytics team followed through on the vision by bringing third-party survey data together with demographics and interaction data to make NPS scores actionable for their executives, clinic managers, and doctors. It's now possible for everyone to track exactly how they stand relative to their goals and get deeper understanding of how to improve customer experiences.

Using a single Tableau dashboard, adjusters can track every claim they have open, follow up with customers and close claims in a much timelier manner. As a result, they’re able to provide a much better service when and where they couldn’t before.


          Tim Hughes, 
Principal Tableau Developer & Admin













      Enable career growth in service
      
Analytics offers a powerful way to transform challenging service jobs into rewarding careers helping customers.  For frontline service teams, analytics can help anyone understand how they are performing and identify where they can improve. For service mangers, analytics can uncover insights that enable them to coach reps more effectively. And for service analysts and operations professionals, analytics can uncover opportunities to creatively use data to deliver better customer experiences. Here’s how three brands have transformed their service organization by using analytics to support career growth.












          Cox Communications field service improves with self-service analytics
         

        Cox Communications provides digital cable television, telecommunications and home automation services in the United States. The field service unit’s goal is to provide the efficient, high quality support. Repeat calls—-when field service has to visit a customer twice in 30-days—-indicate opportunities for improvement. In their TC presentation, Cox Communications shared how they empowered field service reps to see what types of calls drove repeat rates so they could prioritize learning key skills.

          Delta Dental empowers managers to understand calls and coach reps
         

        Delta Dental of Washington is part of the largest dental insurance plan system in the United States. The company implemented speech analytics and now call centere managers are able to automatically see how much time reps are spending on each part of their phone calls. Previously, they would have had to physically listen to a sample of calls. Now, managers can instantly look at patterns from every call, and then coach reps on how to improve metrics like call ownership.

          Charles Schwab’s service analytics team leverages business acumen
         

        Charles Schwab, one of the largest U.S. financial services firms, created an interaction analytics team to understand the voice of the client and collaborate with its business. The team members all have backgrounds as service reps and managers—experiences that helped them create actionable data insights. For example, the team was able to bring data on corporate actions (or company announcements) together with call volume data and predict future calls from Schwab customers. This enabled Schwab to staff their call centers appropriately and provide better, more efficient customer service.

      Turn customer service into everyone’s responsibility
      
Today’s customer experiences are delivered by many stakeholders outside of customer service. For example, positive or negative experiences can be created by account executives, web site developers, product managers, and more. Giving these teams insight into customer satisfaction and preferences—what customers love or hate--is essential to helping your business deliver better customer experiences. Here are service teams that are sharing data with other departments to turn customer service into everyone’s responsibility.












          Tableau informs product developers with customer metrics
         

        Tableau’s technical support team has more than 400 employees that help with more than 100,000 transaction a year. A key area where the team helps customers is with upgrading to new versions of Tableau products, which are released on a quarterly cadence. The team created a dashboard that enabled the product team to see the value of releasing bug-free software by sharing metrics on case support cases per product registration. The metric has become a key quality indicator for the development organization to track that helps them deliver value to Tableau customers.

          VMWare empowers employees to understand customers
         

        The CEO of VMware, a U.S. software company, put customer experience in the company’s goal. He said: “VMware exists to delight our customers, partners and employees."" In response, the analytics team prioritized examining loyalty by understanding its Net Promoter Scores. By providing broader access to the scores and speeding up the delivery of the scores, VMware informed employees outside of service to make the right decision for their customers.

By identifying your greatest service analytics opportunities, we hope that you’ll be able to deliver the customer experiences that differentiate your company and earn you customers for life. Continuously improve every customer touchpoint      The average customer service team uses nine channels to help its customers, according to a Salesforce Study. While some customers still default to calling, many others prefer self-service channels like chatbots, community forums, and knowledge-base articles. As a result of this ongoing digital transformation, service teams need to be able to look at data from every touchpoint to understand customer service performance. Exploring data from web site activity, social media posts, survey ratings, product usage, purchase history, and training activity can be just as important as tracking customer service case records themselves.Here are three companies that are looking at data from across their customer journeys and prioritizing improvements that resolve cases more efficiently or avoid them altogether.Case Study          Verizon optimizes self-service support with chatbots                 Verizon, an American telecommunications with more than 100 million customers, released a Fios on Facebook Messenger chatbot to support stronger customer engagements in 2017. Read the case studyCase Study          Charles Schwab unlocks automated phone technology                 Charles Schwab, one of the largest U.S. financial services firms, takes tens of thousands of calls each day to its contact center. After collecting data from the  to understand where calls came from, what path customers followed in voice prompts to speak with a representative, who made contact with customers, and the outcome, they visualized all the data in a network diagram This helped Schwab improve its data quality and changed the way they focus on customers to enhance their Schwab experience. Sid Dayama, Senior Manager of Data Analytics      Align your service metrics to your vision      To transform your service organization, it’s essential to communicate a vision and tie that vision back to specific metrics. The analytics team followed through on the vision by bringing third-party survey data together with demographics and interaction data to make  scores actionable for their executives, clinic managers, and doctors. Watch the  Presentation NowUsing a single Tableau dashboard, adjusters can track every claim they have open, follow up with customers and close claims in a much timelier manner. Tim Hughes, Principal Tableau Developer & Admin      Enable career growth in service      Analytics offers a powerful way to transform challenging service jobs into rewarding careers helping customers. For frontline service teams, analytics can help anyone understand how they are performing and identify where they can improve. And for service analysts and operations professionals, analytics can uncover opportunities to creatively use data to deliver better customer experiences. Watch the  Presentation Now          Charles Schwab’s service analytics team leverages business acumen                 Charles Schwab, one of the largest U.S. financial services firms, created an interaction analytics team to understand the voice of the client and collaborate with its business. For example, the team was able to bring data on corporate actions (or company announcements) together with call volume data and predict future calls from Schwab customers. This enabled Schwab to staff their call centers appropriately and provide better, more efficient customer service. Tableau informs product developers with customer metrics                 Tableau’s technical support team has more than 400 employees that help with more than 100,000 transaction a year. A key area where the team helps customers is with upgrading to new versions of Tableau products, which are released on a quarterly cadence. Watch the  Presentation Now          are empowers employees to understand customers                 The  of ware, a U.S. software company, put customer experience in the company’s goal. By providing broader access to the scores and speeding up the delivery of the scores, ware informed employees outside of service to make the right decision for their customers. Watch the  Presentation Now          Abercrombie improves customer service through merchandise planning                 For Abercrombie & Fitch, a leading global apparel and accessories retailer, the art of merchandise planning is critical: The company must accurately interpret customer demand and stock stores accordingly. Providing a seamless experience between the store and online is first priority to deliver the quality, personal service that customers want. Read the case study          organ's marketing team prioritizes customer experiences                 organ Chase & Co. (), is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest U.S. banks. Tableau now acts as the front-end for customer analytics and Marketing has built robust data sets tying the line of business relationships like products, marketing, and service touch points with customer data to evaluate customer relationships. Read the case studyCustomer service now has to be the center of everything we do, and we’ve got to be ahead of it before the customer even knows it."

Charles Schwab analyzes call center data to shape quality customer experience with Tableau


 Share



































Annie Worman


          Content & Editorial Manager
        


July 19, 2018










The quality of a company’s customer service comes down to the details. Everyone can relate to calling into a customer service line. The first few interactions with a brand can make or break your perception of the company—and following voice prompts that lead to an unintended or incorrect endpoint can be frustrating and detrimental to that perception.
Charles Schwab is one of the largest publicly-traded financial services firms and data is essential across multiple departments. Schwab’s contact center team looks at how interactions (like the customer service line) affect the overall customer experience, using Tableau to dig deeper into feedback data from customer support calls.
Branden Fulton is a senior data analyst at Schwab, part of the contact center experience team. He and his team analyze call center data with Tableau to uncover what clients are saying about products, services, markets, and news. 
“Our executive management team wants to know what’s happening on our phone systems and what our clients are saying,” shared Branden. The reports represent the voice of the client and appeal to a broad audience of users that range from those in the trenches who speak with customers by phone to executive vice presidents. 
This involves collecting and digging into data from many sources including Hadoop, Splunk, Oracle relational databases, Teradata and others. Bringing everything together with Tableau and optimizing extracts on the Server means Schwab aggregates more extensive data pulls that call center staff access daily. Data quality is stronger too, as they collect details from customer conversations across the team and foster a collective understanding of customer support. 








      Understanding voice response to fulfill customer needs 
      

Making sense of phone conversation data is difficult, especially with tens of thousands of calls each day to the Schwab contact center. What callers say in Schwab’s interactive voice response (IVR) technology, the automated phone system, had been a black box for some time. 
The contact center experience team understands the IVR. However, in circumstances where the IVR’s interpretation of calls wasn’t accurate, they had trouble deciphering intent and sometimes calls about basic tasks like a password reset were routed to the wrong staff. For instance, the IVR picked up the word banana instead of balances through customer’s voices or licensed professionals had to handle password resets instead of focusing on more difficult or technical trading needs.
After collecting data from the IVR to understand where calls came from, what path customers followed in voice prompts to speak with a representative, who made contact with customers, and the outcome, they visualized all the data in a network diagram using Tableau. This helped Schwab improve its data quality and changed the way they focus on customers to enhance their Schwab experience. When working on process improvement projects like the contact center experience team does, seeing the flow of where calls go is critical as they interact with the brand.

Many team members were new to visual analytics, but they were able to get up to speed quickly with Tableau. “Now they’re listening to calls and layering the ability to use Tableau on top,” said Branden. They’re doing speech analytics and using Tableau to tap into that creativity. 
They understand that call center staff don’t always look deeply into what’s happening when they quickly collect data and produce reports. Schwab’s previous view of customer interactions was static, but it’s now dynamic. Their network diagram in Tableau provides a quick, easy glimpse into data errors or inconsistencies and reveals the useful insights that help Branden’s team make important adjustments to best support Schwab clients. 








      Self-service analytics drives a better customer experience
      

Leadership support helped drive Tableau adoption and groups like the contact center experience team are empowered to produce their own reports and deliver a stronger, more personal experience for customers.  For example, the IVR might recognize the customer needs to reset their password and change the experience.
Branden explains that without Tableau, they would take 20 steps backward in how they deliver customer support. As new Tableau features and versions are available, they also embrace them to provide the most recent content to users and keep everyone up-to-date. “Now those receiving and handling the customer calls are making their own impact, helping maintain higher customer satisfaction levels. They’re transitioning into a role where they’re looking at the data behind customer engagement.”  









      Center of Excellence creates strong Tableau community at Schwab
      

Tableau adoption at Schwab has accelerated because of their center of excellence. It includes a leadership committee of eight people from different parts of the company, managing directors and newer, entry-level positions bringing different perspectives around Tableau use. 
They hold monthly user-group sessions where staff share their work and inspire others with new ideas or different approaches to Schwab data. Tableau training sessions complement the gatherings with users talking about data integration or demonstrating their unusual visualizations like Sankey diagrams. With stronger collaboration, Schwab has built a substantial Tableau community that actively participates in the broader Tableau community: “It’s been nothing but good feedback on Tableau. Every time we produce a new Tableau dashboard, people are just amazed with what we can put together and how quickly they can get the information they’re looking for.”
They also conduct monthly Tableau visualization competitions in addition to the user-group and training sessions. Participants are asked to extend outside of their usual data sets and produce a visualization that tests an unfamiliar or new tool or skill. The intent is that this helps them in their role and daily duties.
As a member of the leadership committee and representing the contact center experience team, Branden shared that they like to give something a little more complicated and something a little easier for beginners to support everyone’s needs. 
With fast access to accurate data, the contact center team has the clearest view into customer needs. A new perspective now makes them critical stakeholders in Schwab’s data strategy and champions of change.   
Learn more about how Charles Schwab has scaled Tableau across more than 16,000 users to date and created a center of excellence that is increasing data transparency as Tableau demand grows.

However, in circumstances where the ’s interpretation of calls wasn’t accurate, they had trouble deciphering intent and sometimes calls about basic tasks like a password reset were routed to the wrong staff. For instance, the  picked up the word banana instead of balances through customer’s voices or licensed professionals had to handle password resets instead of focusing on more difficult or technical trading needs.After collecting data from the  to understand where calls came from, what path customers followed in voice prompts to speak with a representative, who made contact with customers, and the outcome, they visualized all the data in a network diagram using Tableau. This helped Schwab improve its data quality and changed the way they focus on customers to enhance their Schwab experience. When working on process improvement projects like the contact center experience team does, seeing the flow of where calls go is critical as they interact with the brand.Many team members were new to visual analytics, but they were able to get up to speed quickly with Tableau. “Now they’re listening to calls and layering the ability to use Tableau on top,” said Branden. They’re doing speech analytics and using Tableau to tap into that creativity. They understand that call center staff don’t always look deeply into what’s happening when they quickly collect data and produce reports. Schwab’s previous view of customer interactions was static, but it’s now dynamic. Their network diagram in Tableau provides a quick, easy glimpse into data errors or inconsistencies and reveals the useful insights that help Branden’s team make important adjustments to best support Schwab clients.       Self-service analytics drives a better customer experience      Leadership support helped drive Tableau adoption and groups like the contact center experience team are empowered to produce their own reports and deliver a stronger, more personal experience for customers.  For example, the  might recognize the customer needs to reset their password and change the experience.Branden explains that without Tableau, they would take 20 steps backward in how they deliver customer support. As new Tableau features and versions are available, they also embrace them to provide the most recent content to users and keep everyone up-to-date. “Now those receiving and handling the customer calls are making their own impact, helping maintain higher customer satisfaction levels. They’re transitioning into a role where they’re looking at the data behind customer engagement.”        Center of Excellence creates strong Tableau community at Schwab      Tableau adoption at Schwab has accelerated because of their center of excellence. It includes a leadership committee of eight people from different parts of the company, managing directors and newer, entry-level positions bringing different perspectives around Tableau use. They hold monthly user-group sessions where staff share their work and inspire others with new ideas or different approaches to Schwab data. Tableau training sessions complement the gatherings with users talking about data integration or demonstrating their unusual visualizations like Sankey diagrams. With stronger collaboration, Schwab has built a substantial Tableau community that actively participates in the broader Tableau community: “It’s been nothing but good feedback on Tableau. Every time we produce a new Tableau dashboard, people are just amazed with what we can put together and how quickly they can get the information they’re looking for.”They also conduct monthly Tableau visualization competitions in addition to the user-group and training sessions. Participants are asked to extend outside of their usual data sets and produce a visualization that tests an unfamiliar or new tool or skill. The intent is that this helps them in their role and daily duties.As a member of the leadership committee and representing the contact center experience team, Branden shared that they like to give something a little more complicated and something a little easier for beginners to support everyone’s needs. With fast access to accurate data, the contact center team has the clearest view into customer needs. A new perspective now makes them critical stakeholders in Schwab’s data strategy and champions of change.

Data is more vital today than ever before. As businesses evolve to keep pace with shifting industries, they must rely on increasing amounts of accurate and timely data to make fast, smart decisions. 
To create a data-driven culture for today’s digital era, organizations must invest in new ways of delivering information, including the people required to lead the charge. This parallel cultural shift is a fundamental change in the relationship between IT and the business; they are two partners working to collect and mine data, but also to refine it and deliver the right information on demand. It’s when IT and business work together that organizations can turn the pipe dream of a self-service analytics culture into a reality. 
This whitepaper will explore the building blocks that comprise a modern analytics platform the business and IT can use—together—to deliver data, value, and decisions for the whole company. This includes the new, shiny tools of today as well as the traditional tools that have been the foundation for business intelligence for decades. 
We will show how each building block fits into the larger process of turning data into insight, whether it’s the tools you need to capture and report on data, or new technologies to share interactive insights. We’ll also discuss how Tableau can be both a foundation for a modern analytics platform and a catalyst for creating a new data-driven analytics culture.
We’ll dive into: 

The three data challenges facing organizations today
The building blocks of a modern analytics platform
Tying it all together

Arguably, more than any other department, IT knows the value of data and the value of being data-driven. IT systems collect and store data for the organization, but you also use data every day to manage, monitor, and maintain a multitude of platforms to support business needs, which creates the perfect opportunity to analyze this data with Tableau. Tableau connects disparate sources of data to provide you with a complete picture of your business. The platform provides data access, data prep, analytics, and API capabilities that are especially useful when aggregating multiple sources of data to centrally manage all your infrastructure, whether it exists in the cloud, in applications, in log files, or in traditional databases. Tableau provides both choice and flexibility to leverage existing technology investments across your heterogeneous environment. See how Tableau enhances your business through IT analytics.

 Share






























JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMC), is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest U.S. banks. The company has grown through mergers and acquisitions with data becoming vital to business operations and strategy—reducing risk, enhancing the customer experience, and offering intelligence to shape future strategy. 
JPMC made a shift from IT-owned to business-owned self-service analytics to keep up with rapid industry changes and better optimize for business success. But in a highly-regulated environment, IT needed to first establish enterprise governance that balanced data access and compliance. Championed by the Center of Excellence and with IT as enablers, JPMC adopted Tableau, expanding from 400 Tableau Server users in 2011 and approaching 30,000 today—driving enterprise-wide data accuracy. 
Today, over 500 teams use Tableau to make strategic decisions that are important to the bank’s health. For example, JPMC’s Marketing Operations team analyzes the customer journey, which influences design decisions for the website, promotional materials, and products like the Chase mobile application. Finance and Branch Managers analyze data to support a stronger customer banking experience. And a variety of roles—from Traders, Operations Analysts, Sales, or Risk and Compliance team members—benefit from Tableau’s API capabilities, which support a seamless analytics experience with existing business applications.  









I think that’s been the biggest contributor to Tableau’s success at JPMC...it evolved from nothing to where we are today because people want to use it.


          Jason Mack, 
Director of Analytics, JPMorgan Chase










      Business-focused IT fosters modern analytics culture approaching 30,000 users 
      

Business groups wanted to feel empowered to solve problems and answer questions of their own data, while adhering to financial services industry compliance and regulations, along with internal data governance standards. 
For a long time, the business relied on legacy tools like Excel and SQL Server. However, this ecosystem created inefficiencies and replication of data, resulting in confusion and inaccuracies. With business intelligence solutions like Cognos or Business Objects, it also took months to assess campaigns for effectiveness. A platform balancing IT governance and data access, but addressing business priorities with immediacy, was needed. 
With new team leadership, IT removed data barriers for business groups and worked with Compliance, Audit, and Risk to develop a governance solution using Tableau. “I would rather create a platform that allows the business to solve their own problems, because we (IT) will never know them all. That’s how I’ve approached our Tableau usage, simply because it allows them to connect to and analyze their own data, which they were already doing,” explained Steven Hittle, Vice President and BI Innovation Leader. 
Providing Tableau access when people had the desire to try something new, JPMC enabled governed self-service at enterprise scale. The Center of Excellence (COE) team played an important role with adoption and continues to set the vision for Tableau and analytics use across JPMC. Eight individuals trained 1,200 new developers and analysts on the platform throughout all of 2017, creating grassroots momentum and sparking interest that’s led to nearly 30,000 current users. With the COE’s help to motivate and train users with classroom learning and Tableau Days (a full-day session with Tableau sales and bank staff collaborating on Tableau), steady wins occurred and created a positive, virtuous cycle of data analytics. 
“I think that’s been the biggest contributor to Tableau’s success at JPMC...it evolved from nothing to where we are today because people want to use it, and not because IT went off in a bubble,” reinforced Jason Mack, Director of Analytics.  The bank has 18 Tableau Server clusters where they monitor usage, performance, and key metrics to make sure everyone is satisfied, there is sufficient data capacity and efficiencies are realized.
By allowing analysts across business teams to question data with Tableau, JPMC has also reduced manual reporting time from months to weeks, which saved thousands of hours and created better enterprise-wide decision-making with elevated transparency. Analysts to C-level executives have gained more time and access to think about data’s impact on the business, have more capacity to innovate and have set more consistent definition of metrics to better understand the journey that customers take with the bank. 


























We put Tableau on our robust customer data sets...to quickly ask questions like 'how many customers have a Freedom and a checking account and use the mobile wallet?'


          Jason Mack, 
Director of Analytics, JPMorgan Chase










      Shaping the customer experience with channel-level marketing metrics
      

While business teams reviewed analytics (e.g., measuring account-specific data and retail data), they struggled with viewing the whole customer and their end-to-end journey. Tableau now acts as the front-end for customer analytics and Marketing has built robust data sets tying the line of business relationships like products, marketing, and service touch points with customer data to evaluate overall customer relationship worth. 
“We put a Tableau front-end on our robust customer data sets that enable analysts to quickly ask questions like ‘how many customers have a Freedom and a checking account and use the mobile wallet,’” explained Jason. This arms JPMC with insights to improve customer satisfaction while growing its customer base.
When launching campaigns, the Marketing team analyzes population data in Tableau to determine optimal targeting. And the operations side looks at customer journey analytics to understand process breaks. It’s important to see why and where customers abandon an action with the bank or where there are key volumes on channels so product improvements can be made. “There are call center metrics. There are website analytics. Everything you can think of from a customer experience where we’re trying to improve customer satisfaction,” added Steven. The outcome is quick wins versus putting items on a roadmap to eventually be addressed.
Marketing also supports JPMC’s retail branches with Tableau dashboards to better understand their market. For instance, certain dashboards help better prospect small businesses. And they’re delivering greater detail on home sales and realtor activity to inform select programs and customer targeting. There’s now a piloted rollout of Tableau to branch staff such as Private Client Bankers and Home Lending Advisors that will eventually include all 5,300+ branches. 









I would rather create a platform that allows the business to solve their own problems, because we (IT) will never know them all. That’s how I’ve approached our Tableau usage, simply because it allows them to connect to and analyze their own data, which they were already doing.


          Steven Hittle, 
Vice President and BI Innovation Leader, JPMorgan Chase










      Tableau adoption by Risk supports data standardization to maintain compliance


When the 2012 economic crisis triggered industry upheaval, focus shifted to increased controls for banks. This tighter regulation strained the relationship, collaboration, and trust between IT and Business. By not having transparent and full trust with line of business data, the cost and risk to JPMC grew, but showing compliance with government regulations was required. The bank’s risk analysis had been done in bulk with Excel, Access, and other tools. This made it difficult to ensure accuracy of the data source and adherence to regulations. To shift this pattern, IT brought along stakeholders from Risk and Compliance to gain support and further spread Tableau.
IT trained them on Tableau and data models to foster a healthier, collaborative working relationship. This eventually opened up Tableau for hundreds of Risk users’ benefit with the right governance framework in place. The team uses Tableau Desktop or Tableau Online to create dashboards with controlled, compliant data that’s served up on Tableau Server to business teams, managers and executives. 
In support of the effort, IT created a new cluster called certified self-service, which goes through a more rigorous process to ensure the SQL is correct, and that people are confident the data is authoritative. It’s made up of 18 Tableau Server clusters with 90 distinct sites. With certified self-service, everything is documented with a data dictionary, so on-the-fly decisions can be made knowing it’s a trusted source. IT verifies the data is performing and it meets security control guidelines. 
“Allowing self-service in one of the most highly regulated spaces – having the standard platform, the right data controls and the right governance in the tool that captures meta data and provides lineage of it in Tableau – users love it because they don’t have to wait for IT and IT loves it because they have happy users,” stated Sriram Belur, Head of Business Intelligence Delivery Center.

            Modern Data Architecture
          













Digital transformation has created a massive influx of data, and it’s not slowing down. Modern BI has lowered the barrier to entry to wide-spread, secure, and governed data for speedy time to insight for business users, but it relies on a backbone of a complete, modern data architecture stack to manage the overall flow of data.
Organizations are collecting, processing, and analyzing more diverse data than ever before. Data formats are multiplying with structured data, semi-structured data (or object storage), and raw, unstructured data in a data lake or in the cloud.


The Tableau Platform fits wherever you are on your digital transformation journey because it's built for flexibility—the ability to move data across platforms, adjust infrastructure on-demand, take advantage of new data types and sources, and enable new users and use cases. We believe your analytics platform should not dictate your data pipeline infrastructure or strategy, but should help you to leverage the investments you’ve already made, including those with partner technologies within the modern data architecture stack.













In this resource, we'll break down the components of modern data architecture, and how Tableau's Technology Partner Ecosystem can support you in building out your analytics stack.










Components of Modern Data Architecture




Create & Connect


Store & Process


Transport & Prepare


Catalog & Govern


Analyze & Augment


Host & Scale

















Create & Connect
Connect Tableau to your data, wherever it lives.
Connecting directly to spreadsheets and business applications makes it easy for analysts to interact directly with the data needed to make better decisions.

Traditional Data Connectivity
In Traditional BI environments, IT prepares and houses data into a centralized repository, which analysts query for analysis. If there’s a need to ask questions about the data outside of this centralized repository, users rely on spreadsheets, data extracts, and other “shadow IT” workarounds.


Modern Data Connectivity
Tableau can connect natively to and live query against your commonly used business applications, allowing analysts and business users to ask questions directly against the data with which they are most familiar. This agile approach accelerates insight delivery, freeing up expert resources for effective data enrichment and advanced analytics modeling.

We chose Tableau to understand our SAP data because of its ease of use and intuitiveness. It will help employees across our company to discover, understand, see trends and outliers in the numbers—so they can take quick action.


          Jerry Pellizzon, Chief Financial Officer, Ceradyne        















Store & Process
Drive optimal performance—regardless of data size or type.
A modern data architecture should handle any data source: cloud applications, big data databases, as well as structured and unstructured repositories.

Traditional Data Storage
Acting as a repository for query-ready data from disparate data sources, data warehouses provide the computing capability and architecture that allow massive amounts of data or summaries of data to be delivered to business users. There will always be a place for traditional databases and data warehouses in a modern analytics infrastructure, and they continue to play a crucial role in delivering governed, accurate, and conformed dimensional data across the enterprise for self-service reporting. 
There are, however, limitations to traditional data warehousing. Firstly, IT must know exactly what kinds of questions analysts are asking in order to build prepared views of the data for fast access to analysts. Secondly, with traditional, on-premises data warehouse deployments, it is a challenge to scale analytics across an increasing number of users.


Modern Data Storage

A modern analytics strategy accepts that not all data questions within an organization can be answered from only one data source. An effective data strategy should enable flexible storage and processing for querying for all types of data. The guiding principle is that analysts and business users more familiar with the data shouldn't need to rely on IT to curate prepared views prior to analysis. Instead, the process becomes iterative—IT grants direct access to the data lake when appropriate for quick queries and operationalizing large data sets in a data warehouse for repeated analysis.
As more workloads and data sources move to the cloud, organizations are also increasingly shifting towards cloud-based data warehouses such as Amazon Redshift, Google Big Query, Snowflake, or Microsoft SQL Data Warehouse. Connecting directly to these data sources opens up the potential for organizations to quickly scale underlying cloud infrastructure as demand for data access surges. Another benefit of modern data warehouses is additional functionality to accelerate data processing. For example, Snowflake and Cloudera can handle analytics on structured and semi-structured data without complex transformation.
Analysis often requires direct connections to source data before it's staged in a data warehouse. This is supported in Tableau with native connections to popular data lakes like Amazon S3 via Redshift Spectrum or Amazon Athena connectors, or the Databricks connector, which allows you to connect directly to Delta Lake for fast, fine-grain data exploration.

With Tableau, you just hook it up to the Redshift server, connect, run a query, and publish it to the Server and you're literally done in an hour. It’s great—it feels like one product.


          Abishek Gupta, Senior Analyst, BOX        















Transport & Prepare
Access, combine, and clean data to serve as a single source of truth.
Data often needs massaging before we can drag and drop in Tableau, whether you're taking a traditional or modern approach.


Traditional Data Pipeline
In the traditional data pipeline, all data must be processed, prepared, and centralized prior to analysis by business users. This process is referred to as “extract-transform-load,” or ETL.
Raw, unstructured data can be extracted, but it often needs massaging and reshaping before it can loaded into a data warehouse. The processes devoted to data prep and structuring require users to wait to access information until the ETL process is complete.



Modern Data Pipeline
Unlike traditional ETL pipelines, in modern analytics scenarios, data can be loaded into a centralized repository prior to being processed. This pattern is called “extract-load-transform,” or ELT.
ELT allows for more flexibility and faster iteration, as transformations happen directly on the raw data, allowing IT to continually test the best possible data transformations prior to loading into a data warehouse. 
Tableau Prep is a great choice for those organizations looking to easily prepare data prior to analysis. For additional ELT capabilities, Tableau has partners like Informatica, Alteryx, Fivetran, Trifacta, Talend, and Datameer that transport and prepare data in a way that works fluidly with Tableau.

We use Alteryx to make sense of massive amounts of data, and we use Tableau to present that. So it's become an incredible tool. It's revolutionizing the way things are being done.


          Bill Engel, Chairman, Consumer Orbit        















Catalog & Govern
Make self-service analytics possible with trusted data.
Data catalogs help users discover certified data assets, so they can spend time asking questions of their data—not asking questions about the quality of that data.

Traditional Data Governance
In a traditional BI environment, governance is often seen as a way for IT to restrict access or lock down data or content. As a consequence, silos are created, resulting in enterprise-wide data that lacks business context and is difficult to discover. When users finally do identify applicable data assets, the validity of that data is often unclear.


Modern Data Governance
In a modern, self-service analytics environment, governance is employed quite differently—as a way to enable and empower your people, rather than restrict them. Data catalogs serve as a shared business glossary of data sources and common data definitions, allowing users to more easily find the right data for decision-making from curated, trusted, and certified data sources. 
With the Tableau Catalog, users can now quickly discover relevant data assets from Tableau Server and Tableau Online. By seamlessly connecting the metadata in enterprise data catalogs from leading vendors such as Informatica, Collibra and Alation, Tableau users can extend the power of the Tableau Catalog to extend to their enterprise data sources.

          Sharon Graves, Enterprise Data Evangelist, GoDaddy        















Analyze & Augment
Analytics get smarter with automated machine learning and natural language capabilities.
Machine Learning and AI improve data access and data quality, uncover previously hidden insights, suggest analyses, deliver predictive analytics, and suggest actions. Natural language interfaces will make it easier for business users to gain insights and make better decisions.


Traditional Data Science
The traditional data science method relies exclusively on data scientists for model development, deployment, and interpretation. This manual approach—separate from a standard analytics practice—is time-consuming and leads to bottlenecks that can make it difficult to deliver insights to the business. 


Modern Data Science
A modern approach to data science, centered around automated machine learning, enables business users to ask questions of their data to reveal predictive and prescriptive insights which are seamlessly integrated into their analytics environment. This frees up data scientists to focus their time on higher-value data aggregation and model creation.
Emerging smart capabilities harness machine learning to assist people with tasks including data preparation, data discovery and understanding of user intent based on historical data-access patterns. To support advanced, predictive analytics, Tableau lets you connect to R and Python libraries and packages, import saved models and write and embed new models into calculations. Tableau also partners with vendors, including DataRobot and RapidMiner, to integrate their advanced analytics platforms designed to support sophisticated predictive modeling.
Natural language processing (NLP) technologies like Ask Data enable users to ask questions of their data using simple text, without understanding the underlying data model. Natural language generation (NLG) technologies can automatically generate stories from data, explaining insights locked within structured data. Tableau integrates with partner NLG technologies such as Narrative Science, Automated Insights, and ARRIA via dashboard extensions to enrich the analytics experience in Tableau.

          Paden Goldsmith, Assistant Director of Strategic Analysis, Florida International University        















Host & Scale
Quickly deploy Tableau and scale it across your organization.
Organizations are increasingly moving business processes and infrastructure to the cloud. Full-cloud and hybrid services have removed some of the major hurdles encountered with on-premises systems, making solutions faster and easier to deploy and manage.

Traditional Analytics Deployment
In a traditional environment, databases and analytic applications are hosted and managed by the organization with technology infrastructure on its own premises. This means the organization is responsible for provisioning sufficient hardware and providing resources to ensure performance scales with future demand. The organization is also actively managing, monitoring, and maintaining the software.


Modern Analytics Deployment
Tableau can be deployed on public-clouds from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure or Alibaba Cloud. There are often benefits in cost, scalability, and flexibility to using infrastructure or platform as a service (IaaS and PaaS).
Web-based analytics can also be delivered as software-as-a-service (SaaS). Tableau Online is your analytics platform fully hosted in the cloud. This means you don’t have to worry about hardware or software maintenance. A hybrid model for analytics allows you to connect to data regardless of the database in which it’s stored or the infrastructure upon which it’s hosted.
One of the greatest benefits of analytics in the cloud is flexibility. There's not a lot of setup required as there has been in traditional models, nor are there the same concerns around storage limits, cluster overhead, or performance. This gives users the freedom to try things, fail quickly, and move on to something else. You don't have to know where you're going—you have the freedom to explore, discover, and modernize your analytics strategy.
Tableau’s approach to cloud is simple: It’s all about choice. The choice of how and where you deploy your analytics; the choice to analyze any data, regardless of where it resides. From a fully-hosted SaaS solution, to a hybrid approach of your own software deployed on a cloud platform or on-premises, Tableau lets you deploy and manage your analytics on your own terms.

Modern  has lowered the barrier to entry to wide-spread, secure, and governed data for speedy time to insight for business users, but it relies on a backbone of a complete, modern data architecture stack to manage the overall flow of data.Organizations are collecting, processing, and analyzing more diverse data than ever before. Data formats are multiplying with structured data, semi-structured data (or object storage), and raw, unstructured data in a data lake or in the cloud.The Tableau Platform fits wherever you are on your digital transformation journey because it's built for flexibility—the ability to move data across platforms, adjust infrastructure on-demand, take advantage of new data types and sources, and enable new users and use cases. We believe your analytics platform should not dictate your data pipeline infrastructure or strategy, but should help you to leverage the investments you’ve already made, including those with partner technologies within the modern data architecture stack.In this resource, we'll break down the components of modern data architecture, and how Tableau's Technology Partner Ecosystem can support you in building out your analytics stack.Components of Modern Data ArchitectureCreate & ConnectStore & ProcessTransport & PrepareCatalog & GovernAnalyze & AugmentHost & ScaleCreate & ConnectConnect Tableau to your data, wherever it lives.Connecting directly to spreadsheets and business applications makes it easy for analysts to interact directly with the data needed to make better decisions.Traditional Data ConnectivityIn Traditional  environments,  prepares and houses data into a centralized repository, which analysts query for analysis. If there’s a need to ask questions about the data outside of this centralized repository, users rely on spreadsheets, data extracts, and other “shadow ” workarounds.Modern Data ConnectivityTableau can connect natively to and live query against your commonly used business applications, allowing analysts and business users to ask questions directly against the data with which they are most familiar. This agile approach accelerates insight delivery, freeing up expert resources for effective data enrichment and advanced analytics modeling.Salesforce Dashboard StartersAccelerate sales analysis with out-of-the-box dashboards.Learn moreServiceNow Dashboard StartersAnalyze incidents and requests for faster response.Learn moreGoogle Ads ConnectorGet started with Google Ads Connector to improve campaign performance.Learn more  SolutionsConnect directly to   and .Learn moreWe chose Tableau to understand our  data because of its ease of use and intuitiveness. Jerry Pellizzon, Chief Financial Officer, Ceradyne        Store & ProcessDrive optimal performance—regardless of data size or type.A modern data architecture should handle any data source: cloud applications, big data databases, as well as structured and unstructured repositories.Traditional Data StorageActing as a repository for query-ready data from disparate data sources, data warehouses provide the computing capability and architecture that allow massive amounts of data or summaries of data to be delivered to business users. There will always be a place for traditional databases and data warehouses in a modern analytics infrastructure, and they continue to play a crucial role in delivering governed, accurate, and conformed dimensional data across the enterprise for self-service reporting. Secondly, with traditional, on-premises data warehouse deployments, it is a challenge to scale analytics across an increasing number of users.Modern Data StorageA modern analytics strategy accepts that not all data questions within an organization can be answered from only one data source. Instead, the process becomes iterative— grants direct access to the data lake when appropriate for quick queries and operationalizing large data sets in a data warehouse for repeated analysis.As more workloads and data sources move to the cloud, organizations are also increasingly shifting towards cloud-based data warehouses such as Amazon Redshift, Google Big Query, Snowflake, or Microsoft  Data Warehouse. For example, Snowflake and Cloudera can handle analytics on structured and semi-structured data without complex transformation.Analysis often requires direct connections to source data before it's staged in a data warehouse. Abishek Gupta, Senior Analyst,         Transport & PrepareAccess, combine, and clean data to serve as a single source of truth.Data often needs massaging before we can drag and drop in Tableau, whether you're taking a traditional or modern approach.Traditional Data PipelineIn the traditional data pipeline, all data must be processed, prepared, and centralized prior to analysis by business users. The processes devoted to data prep and structuring require users to wait to access information until the  process is complete.Modern Data PipelineUnlike traditional  pipelines, in modern analytics scenarios, data can be loaded into a centralized repository prior to being processed.

Bill Engel, Chairman, Consumer Orbit        Catalog & GovernMake self-service analytics possible with trusted data.Data catalogs help users discover certified data assets, so they can spend time asking questions of their data—not asking questions about the quality of that data.Traditional Data GovernanceIn a traditional  environment, governance is often seen as a way for  to restrict access or lock down data or content. When users finally do identify applicable data assets, the validity of that data is often unclear.Modern Data GovernanceIn a modern, self-service analytics environment, governance is employed quite differently—as a way to enable and empower your people, rather than restrict them. By seamlessly connecting the metadata in enterprise data catalogs from leading vendors such as Informatica, Collibra and Alation, Tableau users can extend the power of the Tableau Catalog to extend to their enterprise data sources.

Manufacturing is an industry with many moving parts: human resources, raw materials, capital investments, production equipment, logistics—not to mention ever-changing customer demands. Data gets created at every turn, but it often stays in silos, limited in its utility. This holds true for all manufacturers—whether aerospace and defense, automotive, industrial machinery, or mill products. With Tableau, you can quickly blend and link similar data to gain decisive results in seconds—compared to hours or days with programming-intensive methods. Use what you learn from your manufacturing analytics to improve process efficiency, centralize production monitoring, better serve your customers, and turn real-time data into just-in-time insights.








      Making Sense of Industrial Sensor Data
      









By leveraging Tableau’s leading analytics platform, GE Aviation is making it easier for airlines to access, understand and take action on this data. Airlines can now explore customer reports created in Tableau through Predix, GE’s cloud-based software platform for industrial applications. Airlines can perform further analysis of sensor data from the flight (from engines, airframes, flaps, landing gear etc.) as well as the health of the aircraft itself (ground operations, maintenance, crewing etc.) with Tableau’s powerful, easy-to-use platform.

Whitepaper: 4 Ways Data is Transforming the Industry

Like it or not, manufacturing is moving faster and leaner as the dated, status-quo business systems fall to the wayside. More than ever, the manufacturing industry must corral and understand massive amounts of data from many systems to drive operational efficiencies, higher levels of service, and support. Having the ability to explore the impact and interplay across production efficiency, product quality, customer demand, and service excellence simply isn't possible without big data and meaningful analytics.

Maximize the possibilities of your sales data
In any sales organization, you build competitive advantage by understanding both the big picture and the on-the-ground details; a thousand-foot view without losing sight of the day-to-day activities that close deals. This is more true today than ever before, as the shift to digital is accelerating—and only by fully leveraging data can we achieve success.
In this whitepaper, you'll learn:

How to get a complete view of the metrics that sales operations needs to support better forecasting, planning, and real-time decision-making.
Considerations for integrating customer, finance, and marketing data fundamental to understanding selling scenarios and competitive advantages.
Why using interactive visualizations and shared dashboards can bring your sales reporting to life with stronger collaboration across your organization.
How to power any sales use case inside and outside your CRM, including growth potential and new targets, in-depth pipeline risk assessment, staffing allocation, profitability analysis, distance to quota, and more.
How companies like LinkedIn, MillerCoors, and others are modernizing their sales analytics with Tableau.

How do you set a smarter sales strategy with data?
Organizations that are able to harness their data are the ones that are most successfully leading through these unprecedented times. And with a powerful business intelligence and analytics platform, you can leverage all of the data in your enterprise to build actionable insights quickly and consistently.
Sales KPIs—including sales performance, cost-to-revenue ratios, and quota attainment—are only a few of the many metrics that will create the holistic picture of dynamic sales environments. But how do you achieve such an expansive view of your sales processes?
Like every other part of the modern enterprise, sales teams need to harness data to answer their most important questions:

How do I know what’s actually working and what’s not moving the needle?
How do I forecast in an environment that’s constantly changing?
How do I avoid making decisions too late and get ahead of the forces buffeting my business?

Predictive modeling functions

New prediction table calcs go beyond the existing trend line analytics function to build a model that understands how your data is distributed around a best-fit line. Using a linear regression model by default, MODEL_QUANTILE returns a target value at a specified percentile where MODEL_PERCENTILE returns the probability of the expected value being less than or equal to the observed mark. Change the model in the expression to regularized linear regression or Gaussian process regression and immediately see how that change impacts the predictions when compared to historical data.

Self-service data preparation

Tableau Prep changes the way traditional data prep is performed in an organization. By providing a visual and direct way to combine, shape and clean data, Tableau Prep makes it easier for analysts and business users to start their analysis, faster. 
Tableau Prep is comprised of two products: Tableau Prep Builder for building your data flows, and Tableau Prep Conductor for scheduling, monitoring and managing flows across the organization.












      Tableau Prep Builder
      

Combine, shape, and clean your data for analysis
 






      A complete picture of your data
    

Three coordinated views let you see row-level data, profiles of each column, and your entire data preparation process. Pick which view to interact with based on the task at hand. 
    

Start a free trial



 
Tableau Prep Builder is part of Tableau Creator. See offerings and pricing.














      Immediate results


If you want to edit a value, you select and directly edit. Change your join type, and see the result right away. With each action, you instantly see your data change, even on millions of rows of data. Tableau Prep Builder gives you the freedom to re-order steps and experiment without consequence.
    
















      Work smarter, work faster
    

Use smart features to fix common data prep challenges. Tableau Prep Builder employs fuzzy clustering to turn repetitive tasks, like grouping by pronunciation, into one click operations.
    

Start a free trial

















      Connect to more data
    

Connect to data on premises or in the cloud, whether it’s a database or a spreadsheet. Access, combine and clean disparate data without writing code. Tableau Prep Builder intelligently pushes operations down to the database when possible, letting you take advantage of existing database investments for fast flow execution performance.

Before Tableau Prep our team would spend hours and hours making sure that our data sources were clean and organized, just to make sure that our analysis was accurate and effective. We’ve been able to save hours of work with Tableau Prep, completely reinventing the way we look at our data, and dramatically shortening the time between data collection and actionable insights.

Seagate:
Put data to work.


If I didn't start using Tableau, I would still be using Excel. I would still have a fear of data. And then I wouldn't have a bigger view of how data can help in my day-to-day work.
Eunice Lim, Senior Manager, Business Analytics







Allstate:
Discover answers that matter.


Before, it was always numbers in rows and columns. Now I’m eager to do a new analysis, because it's so much easier to actually see the trends, the story, and the power that the data brings.
Marta Magnuszewska, Special Investigation Unit Analyst

            Modern Governance for Data & Analytics
          











Governance is no longer a choice between flexibility and usefulness to the business and tight IT control. Now IT and business users can work together to define a governance model that enables everyone and ensures data quality, content security, and consistency. Appropriate governance protects your data while also encouraging widespread adoption of analytics across your organization -- giving the business easy access for exploring and finding hidden insight.









Governance for self-service
Governance is built on consistency, security, and reliability. Empowering the business does not have to be a trade off with security. Governing data and managing content should be done alongside business stakeholders as part of the Modern Approach to Enterprise Analytics. By providing reliable access to standardized data — IT builds trust with the business. That trust is founded on secure and consistent data — instilling confidence in each user to access, analyze, and share their insights with peers. 

Trusted data 
Data is the foundation for all analytics, the more accurate, complete, and current the data, the more accurate the resulting analysis. Tableau helps IT build, manage, and share data centrally through Tableau Server. Whether you’re connecting live to on-premises data warehouses and cloud applications or creating high performance extracts, your business users can focus on analyzing instead of verifying data. By centralizing data, IT helps create a single source of truth, prevents redundancy, and increases performance through caching. 


Shared responsibilities
A strong relationship between IT and the business is the foundation for self-service analytics. Tableau makes it easy for department and team owners to take on repetitive tasks that used to fall to IT. Business owners can manage their own analytics workspaces, including adding new users, managing data, promoting content, and sharing with other groups. This frees IT to focus on platform governance, system reliability, and enabling more users with data and analytics.

Trusted content
Sharing and collaborating with analytics is how your organization makes better decisions. With Tableau, people can explore and create new content within their teams sandbox environment, then polish and publish finalized work to a production environment. Tableau supports your preferred content promotion workflows. We also enable individual business users to explore, experiment, and collaborate with their teams—while respecting the boundaries you’ve set. Permissions for viewing, editing, publishing, and exporting content can be controlled on a per user or group basis, making sure your content is accessible and secure. 













Governed self-service analytics at scale
What does it mean to go beyond discovering insights to driving meaningful change across the entire organization? To achieve this, people across teams must work together, communicating their insights and leveraging each other’s work. And you, IT, are the central actor that makes all of this possible. People in your organization are already using Excel and other tools to answer their questions. So how do you take charge and enable self-service analytics while also making sure the data is governed, trusted, and secure?

PepsiCo cuts analysis time by 90%

PepsiCo gathers data from retail customers, consolidating warehouse, point-of-sale, and production data. But relying on Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel for wrangling and analysis led to messy, inaccurate data. PepsiCo’s Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment (CPFR) team realized they needed a modern analytics platform to help govern their data.

Augmented Analytics
Smarter with Einstein, we’re powering up everyone’s decision-making


 










Augmented Analytics




Ask Data


Explain Data


Ask Data for Salesforce


Einstein Discovery for Reports




















Augmented analytics is a class of analytics powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) that expands a human’s ability to interact with data at a contextual level. We use AI to make analytics accessible so that more people can confidently explore and interact with data to drive meaningful decisions. From automated modeling to guided natural language queries, our augmented analytics capabilities are powerful and trusted to help organizations leverage their growing amount of data and empower a wider business audience to discover insights.
Watch Now




















There’s a growing disconnect between business leaders expecting a data-driven organization, and employees who either aren’t comfortable questioning metrics or leveraging data analysis to drive actions. We’re excited to get AI into the hands of everyone to help answer relevant questions, make meaningful decisions and ultimately transform their business.




          Francois Ajenstat, 
Chief Product Officer, Tableau













      Ask Data
      







Ask Data allows people to use natural language to interact with data through a fast, powerful interface—it's as simple as typing a question with guided search suggestions to get instant answers. Results come in the form of rich data visualizations that enable business users to get the insights they want from their data.









 
Start asking questions with Ask Data
Try out Ask Data on Superstore, a global retail data set. Ask questions about sales by location or determine what total profit looks like each month.
Start interactive demo 




















Ask Data opens up an opportunity to close the gap between advanced analysts and a broader, general business audience, allowing anyone to connect and explore data.


          Ilya Kovalenko, 
Data Analyst & Visualization Team Lead, Siemens













      Explain Data
      







Explain Data automatically provides AI-driven explanations for the value of a data point with a single click. Based on advanced statistical models, explanations are integrated in existing workflows, saving users’ time and unearthing new understandings about their data that they may not have found otherwise. The interactive feature offers analysts and business users alike a jumping-off point to fuel deeper data exploration.









 

Get explanations with Explain Data

Try out Explain Data on Superstore, a global retail data set. Dive into possible explanations about profitability variance and outliers by state, and explore further with Ask Data on the dashboard.

      Ask Data for Salesforce
      







Ask Data for Salesforce enables Salesforce users to ask any question using natural language* and semantic search, and get instant answers in the form of insights, instantly generated reports, and recommended dashboards, tailored to the context of their business. Because Einstein learns the structure and context of language in your organization directly from CRM, you spend less time coming up with the right question, and more time taking action on intelligent insights.
*Natural language queries will be generally available early next year.












      Einstein Discovery for Reports
      









Einstein Discovery for Reports automatically gives you AI-powered insights directly within your Salesforce Reports, helping you quickly understand what happened and why it happened, so you can take action intelligently. Einstein scans your report data quickly and thoroughly using machine learning and comprehensive statistical analysis. And, with just a few clicks, users can dive into the associated Einstein Discovery story for deeper analysis.

            Platform Security
          













You need to keep proprietary data and your analytics secure meanwhile still providing access for authorized users. With Tableau, you can. Create an easy-to-find, easy-to-secure destination for your data and your content. And say goodbye to the “just email me that spreadsheet” mindset.









Authentication
Tableau Server supports industry-standard authentication including Active Directory, Kerberos, OpenId Connect, SAML, trusted tickets, and certificates. Tableau Server also has its own built-in user identity service — Local Authentication. Tableau Server creates and maintains an account for each named user on the system which persists across sessions for a consistent personalized experience. In addition, authors and publishers can use server-wide identity information in views they publish to control what data other users can see and download.

Data Security
Whether you’re a bank, school, hospital, or government agency, you can’t afford to lose control of your data assets. Tableau has a breadth of options to help you fulfill your security objectives. You can choose to implement security solely based on your database authentication, or implement security solely in Tableau, or select a hybrid security model in which user information in Tableau Server corresponds to data elements in the underlying database. Tableau Online reinforces your existing data security strategies and meets SOX, SOC, and ISAE industry compliance standards. 


Authorization
Tableau Server roles and permissions provide administrators with fine-grained control over the data, content, and objects a user can access and the actions a user or group can perform on that content. You can also control who can add comments, save workbooks, and connect to specific data sources. Group permissions let you manage many users at once. User and group roles are also available within workbooks to allow filtering and control of data within dashboards. This means you only have to maintain a single dashboard for all of your regions, clients, or teams, and they will only see their own data. 

Network Security
Your network security devices help protect your on-premises deployment of Tableau Server from being accessed by untrusted networks and the Internet. And when access to Tableau Server is not restricted, transmission security becomes even more critical. Tableau Server uses the robust security capabilities of SSL/TLS to encrypt transmissions from clients to Tableau Server and from Tableau Server to your databases. Tableau helps you protect your data, users, and content from the outside world.













Tableau Server Platform Security
Tableau is a modern enterprise analytics platform that enables self-service analytics at scale through governance. Security is the first and most critical part of a data and content governance strategy. Tableau Server provides the comprehensive features and deep integration to address all aspects of enterprise security. Tableau helps organizations promote trusted data sources for all users, so the right data is used to make the right decisions quickly. As the promise of a single central EDW wanes and data proliferation continues to accelerate powered by the cloud, managing consistent security across all the various platforms becomes crucial for your enterprises.

            A Guide To Data Driven Decision Making: What It Is, Its Importance, & How To Implement It
          












What is data-driven decision-making?

Data-driven decision-making (DDDM) is defined as using facts, metrics, and data to guide strategic business decisions that align with your goals, objectives, and initiatives. When organizations realize the full value of their data, that means everyone—whether you’re a business analyst, sales manager, or human resource specialist—is empowered to make better decisions with data, every day. However, this is not achieved by simply choosing the appropriate analytics technology to identify the next strategic opportunity.
Your organization needs to make data-driven decision-making the norm—creating a culture that encourages critical thinking and curiosity. People at every level have conversations that start with data and they develop their data skills through practice and application. Foundationally, this requires a self-service model, where people can access the data they need, balanced with security and governance. It also requires proficiency, creating training and development opportunities for employees to learn data skills. Finally, having executive advocacy and a community that supports and makes data-driven decisions will encourage others to do the same.
Establishing these core capabilities will help encourage data-driven decision-making across all job levels so business groups will regularly question and investigate information to discover powerful insights that drive action.

The importance of data-driven decision-making

The amount of information collected has never been greater, but it’s also more complex. This makes it difficult for organizations to manage and analyze their data. In fact, NewVantage Partners recently reported that 98.6 percent of executives indicate that their organization aspires to a data-driven culture, while only 32.4 percent report having success. A 2018 IDC study also noted that organizations have invested trillions of dollars to modernize their business, but 70 percent of these initiatives fail because they prioritized technology investments without building a data culture to support it.
In pursuit to be data-driven, many enterprises are developing three core capabilities: data proficiency, analytics agility, and community. Transforming how your company makes decisions is no easy task, but incorporating data and analytics into decision-making cycles is how you will see the most transformative impact on your organization. This level of transformation requires a dedicated approach to developing and refining your analytics program.









Organizations benefiting from data-driven decision-making

Thanks to modern business intelligence, organizations are inching closer and closer to understanding the value of data-driven decision-making across all departments and roles. Here are a few examples of organizations that are effectively leveraging the value of their people and their data.











Lufthansa group increased organizational efficiency by 30%





Lufthansa Group is a global aviation group that at one point, had no uniformity with analytics reporting across its 550-plus subsidiaries. Using one analytics platform, they increased efficiency by 30 percent, gained greater flexibility in decision making, and increased departmental autonomy. “We’re in a stronger position to create and design our analyses independently and a lot of people now understand the central importance of data for the success of Lufthansa,” shared Heiko Merten, Head of BI Applications in Sales.







Providence St. Joseph Health improved quality measures and cost-of-care





Providence St. Joseph Health, a 51-hospital system with 100,000-plus caregivers, delivers high-quality, cost-effective healthcare to millions of patients annually. Patient data resides in many systems, but managing and integrating growing amounts of data is a complex task. Providence built dashboards accessible to the hospital system that make quality and cost data more transparent so providers can substantially improve quality measures and reduce cost of care. “We’ve moved the needle on the difficult-to-improve quality outcomes across the system and I believe part of that is because we’re all speaking a common language,” explained Dr. Ari Robicsek, Chief Medical Analytics Officer.







Charles Schwab Corporation increased their speed to business insights





The Charles Schwab Corporation is one of the largest publicly-traded financial services firms based on client assets. Data is fundamental to enhancing the customer experience, driving operational leverage, and reducing risk. With growing staff interest in data and analytics, they rethought their capacity planning and data support model, opting for an enterprise BI platform that supports analysts and novice business users. “Without our visual analytics solution, we would be stuck analyzing enormous amounts of data in spreadsheets. Instead, our dashboards provide clear actionable insights that drive the business forward,” stated Donald Lay, Senior Business Intelligence Manager.

6 steps to effectively make data-driven decisions

These steps can help you can find the “who, what, where, when, and why” to make the most of data—for you, for colleagues, and the business. But keep in mind that the cycle of visual analysis isn’t linear. One question often leads to another, which may mean you need to go back to one of these steps or skip to another—eventually leading to valuable insights.
Step 1 - Identify business objectives:  This step will require an understanding of your organization’s executive and downstream goals. This could be as specific as increasing sales numbers and website traffic or as ambiguous as increasing brand awareness. This will help you later in the process to choose key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that influence decisions made from data—and these will help you determine which data to analyze and what questions to ask so your analysis supports key business objectives. For instance, if a marketing campaign focuses on driving website traffic, a KPI could be tied to the amount of contact submissions captured so sales can follow-up with leads.
Step 2 - Survey business teams for key sources of data:  To ensure success, it is crucial to get inputs from people across the organization to understand short and long term goals. These inputs help inform the questions that people ask in their analysis and how you prioritize certified data sources.
Valuable inputs from across the organization will help to guide your analytics deployment and future state—including the roles, responsibilities, architecture, and processes, as well as the success measurements to understand progress.
Step 3 - Collect and prepare the data you need: Accessing quality, trusted data can be a big hurdle if your business information sits in many disconnected sources. Once you have an idea of the breadth of data sources across your organization, you can start data preparation.
Start by preparing data sources with high impact and low complexity. Prioritize data sources with the biggest audiences so you can make an immediate impact. Use these sources to start building a high-impact dashboard.
Marketing agency Tinuiti centralized more than 100 data sources with an analytics platform that supports faster data preparation to create custom dashboards for 500-plus clients and give them the full story of their brand efforts.
 
Step 4 - View and explore data: Visualizing your data is crucial to DDDM. Representing your insights in a visually impactful way means you’ll have a better chance of influencing the decisions of senior leadership and other staff.
With many visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization is an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. There are many popular visualization types to effectively display information: a bar chart for comparison, a map for spatial data, a line chart for temporal data, a scatter plot to compare two measures, and more.

Step 5 - Develop insights: Critical thinking with data means finding insights and communicating them in a useful, engaging way. Visual analytics is an intuitive approach to ask and answer questions of your data. Discover opportunities or risks that impact success or problem-solving.
JPMorgan Chase embraced a modern analytics solution to make decisions that are important to the bank’s health. JPMC gains a comprehensive view of the customer’s journey by reviewing line-of-business relationships (i.e. products, marketing, and service touch points) with customer data. For example, the Marketing Operations team performs analyses that influence design decisions for the website, promotional materials, and products like the Chase mobile application.
Step 6 - Act on and share your insights: Once you discover an insight, you need to take action or share it with others for collaboration. One way to do this is by sharing dashboards. Highlighting key insights by using informative text and interactive visualizations can impact your audience’s decisions and help them take more-informed actions in their daily work.

With an analytics platform such as Tableau, you can create and share dashboards in a secure, governed environment where others can search, view, and reference data in their workflows. To ensure that you are serving the needs of your organization, you should regularly evaluate governance models and data sources so people can find the data they need.
Data-driven decision-making is transformational. When visual analytics is embraced by everyone in an organization, data becomes a critical enterprise asset. With a modern business intelligence solution, data-driven decision-making becomes a company mission, more than a hassle. This leads to faster, more-informed decisions. And these decisions will generate a stronger bottom line, greater creativity and commercial success, and more engagement and collaboration from employees.

When organizations realize the full value of their data, that means everyone—whether you’re a business analyst, sales manager, or human resource specialist—is empowered to make better decisions with data, every day. However, this is not achieved by simply choosing the appropriate analytics technology to identify the next strategic opportunity.Your organization needs to make data-driven decision-making the norm—creating a culture that encourages critical thinking and curiosity. Finally, having executive advocacy and a community that supports and makes data-driven decisions will encourage others to do the same.Establishing these core capabilities will help encourage data-driven decision-making across all job levels so business groups will regularly question and investigate information to discover powerful insights that drive action.The importance of data-driven decision-makingThe amount of information collected has never been greater, but it’s also more complex. A 2018  study also noted that organizations have invested trillions of dollars to modernize their business, but 70 percent of these initiatives fail because they prioritized technology investments without building a data culture to support it.In pursuit to be data-driven, many enterprises are developing three core capabilities: data proficiency, analytics agility, and community. Transforming how your company makes decisions is no easy task, but incorporating data and analytics into decision-making cycles is how you will see the most transformative impact on your organization. This level of transformation requires a dedicated approach to developing and refining your analytics program.Organizations benefiting from data-driven decision-makingThanks to modern business intelligence, organizations are inching closer and closer to understanding the value of data-driven decision-making across all departments and roles. Here are a few examples of organizations that are effectively leveraging the value of their people and their data.Lufthansa group increased organizational efficiency by 30%Lufthansa Group is a global aviation group that at one point, had no uniformity with analytics reporting across its 550-plus subsidiaries. “We’re in a stronger position to create and design our analyses independently and a lot of people now understand the central importance of data for the success of Lufthansa,” shared Heiko Merten, Head of  Applications in Sales.Providence St. Joseph Health improved quality measures and cost-of-careProvidence St. Joseph Health, a 51-hospital system with 100,000-plus caregivers, delivers high-quality, cost-effective healthcare to millions of patients annually. “We’ve moved the needle on the difficult-to-improve quality outcomes across the system and I believe part of that is because we’re all speaking a common language,” explained Dr. Ari Robicsek, Chief Medical Analytics Officer.Charles Schwab Corporation increased their speed to business insightsThe Charles Schwab Corporation is one of the largest publicly-traded financial services firms based on client assets. Donald Lay, Senior Business Intelligence Manager at Charles Schwab CorporationTry Tableau for free to create beautiful visualizations with your data.Try Tableau for free6 steps to effectively make data-driven decisionsThese steps can help you can find the “who, what, where, when, and why” to make the most of data—for you, for colleagues, and the business. For instance, if a marketing campaign focuses on driving website traffic, a  could be tied to the amount of contact submissions captured so sales can follow-up with leads.Step 2 - Survey business teams for key sources of data:  To ensure success, it is crucial to get inputs from people across the organization to understand short and long term goals. These inputs help inform the questions that people ask in their analysis and how you prioritize certified data sources.Valuable inputs from across the organization will help to guide your analytics deployment and future state—including the roles, responsibilities, architecture, and processes, as well as the success measurements to understand progress.Step 3 - Collect and prepare the data you need: Accessing quality, trusted data can be a big hurdle if your business information sits in many disconnected sources. Representing your insights in a visually impactful way means you’ll have a better chance of influencing the decisions of senior leadership and other staff.With many visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization is an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. There are many popular visualization types to effectively display information: a bar chart for comparison, a map for spatial data, a line chart for temporal data, a scatter plot to compare two measures, and more.Step 5 - Develop insights: Critical thinking with data means finding insights and communicating them in a useful, engaging way. Highlighting key insights by using informative text and interactive visualizations can impact your audience’s decisions and help them take more-informed actions in their daily work.Market Overview Dashboard from BoeingThis dashboard from Boeing uses 10 charts to give viewers different perspectives and a chance to discover new insights about airplane demand over the next 15+ years.Explore the Public VizWith an analytics platform such as Tableau, you can create and share dashboards in a secure, governed environment where others can search, view, and reference data in their workflows. To ensure that you are serving the needs of your organization, you should regularly evaluate governance models and data sources so people can find the data they need.Data-driven decision-making is transformational."

            Tableau Server Management
          

            Manage Tableau Server at Scale
          

Start a Trial in your Tableau Server Deployment




















Enhanced manageability, scalability and security

Tableau Server Management makes it easier to run large, mission-critical Tableau Server deployments. With Tableau Server Management, you can react quickly to the changing needs of your business and save time by streamlining the management process.
Learn about our deployment pricing















Better visibility for efficient Server management

Get the most out of your Windows or Linux deployment, through enhanced agent-based monitoring with the Tableau Resource Monitoring Tool. The Resource Monitoring Tool offers deep insights into the health and performance of a Tableau Server cluster by parsing and analyzing the logs generated by overall Server usage and combining that with monitoring of physical system usage (CPU Usage, RAM, Disk I/O etc.). Threshold based monitoring helps you stay on top of the health of your deployment. With increased visibility into hardware utilization, VizQL sessions, data source queries, backgrounder workloads and more, it’s easier to manage and precisely tune the performance of your server.















Simplified content migration

Simplify and streamline your workbook and data source content workflows with the Tableau Content Migration Tool. Manage the movement of content between projects, sites or Tableau Server environments. Build your migration plan visually, and then set it to a schedule. You can remap data sources, and perform other workbook transformations.















Leverage cloud services for better reliability and scalability

For large deployments hosted on AWS or Azure, customers can choose to host their Tableau Server metadata repository externally, with Amazon RDS Postgres or Azure Database for PostgreSQL. This approach provides increased scalability and high availability for organizations with large amounts of Tableau metadata.















Optimize  workloads

Optimize the performance of your deployment by customizing which nodes process background jobs such as extract refreshes and subscriptions. By isolating these workloads to specific nodes, it's easier to scale your deployment to the needs of your organization.









      Additional resources for IT
      

Discover more tools to help deploy, support, and scale Tableau analytics across your organization.

KMS Integration for encrypted extracts

For data extract encryption at rest, we integrate with Amazon KMS. For existing AWS KMS customers, this capability helps you centralize your key management efforts and unlocks more advanced security and compliance scenarios.















External file store support

With Tableau Server Management, you can leverage network storage devices for backup snapshots which significantly reduces the time required to perform a back up. You can also use this capability to streamline your deployment topology by centralizing your file store, eliminating the need to run file stores on multiple nodes in a Tableau Server cluster.









Pricing
Our offerings match Tableau capabilities with the unique needs of different types of users to create, explore, and view trusted content with Tableau’s governed self-service analytics platform.

Red Hat embraces Tableau Blueprint and Tableau Online, deepens data culture with 4,500+ staff in less than a year



Doubled Tableau Online user base to 4,500+ in first year


Integrated 60+ data sources


Nurtured internal community and data leaders












 Share






























Red Hat, Inc. is the world's leading provider of open source solutions, using a community-powered approach to deliver reliable and high-performing Linux, hybrid cloud, container, and Kubernetes technologies. Red Hat helps customers integrate new and existing IT applications, develop cloud-native applications, standardize industry-leading operating systems, and automate, secure, and manage complex environments. Growing at an accelerated rate, Red Hat used a variety of business intelligence tools in isolated situations, but lacked a coordinated approach to their enterprise analytics. With a disconnected data strategy, leaders found it complicated to see the big picture as they made key business decisions. Global staff, particularly data analysts and data engineers, also struggled to make connections among siloed data. They needed an analytics platform that spanned multiple sources, ensured agile performance, and enabled cloud-based collaboration. Red Hat decommissioned several other business intelligence platforms and replaced them with a SaaS solution—Tableau Online, combined with Tableau Blueprint to guide their deployment strategy. Focusing on the pillars of community and proficiency, Red Hat scaled from 50 Tableau users to more than 4,500 in the first year, doubling adoption expectations in the first three months. By shifting away from multiple tools, associates were better armed with insights to make quick, confident decisions that improved performance and results. They continue to grow engagement opportunities and training, spearheaded by a new role called the Tableau Enablement Lead, part of the Enterprise Data and Analytics team, along with Tableau advocates, referred to as Project Owners, who implement and share dashboard best practices as members of the Red Hat Tableau community.








      Creating data-driven processes to support 4,500+ employees, guided by Tableau Blueprint
      

When Red Hat adopted Tableau, they used Tableau Blueprint to guide their deployment journey. “Blueprint demonstrated to us how Tableau approaches governance to enable speed, and that isn’t something we saw before,” explained Wes Gelpi, Senior Manager of Business Intelligence & Analytics. Blueprint helped analytics leadership set clear expectations and processes for governance, proficiency, collaboration, and more. “Tableau Blueprint enabled us to deploy more effectively and it changed how we think about Tableau going forward,” added Wes.


















      Building out strategy and teams to grow community and nurture data leaders


The first order of business was building out the right strategy and teams, which included a new organizational model aligning resources to business areas and documenting their enterprise data strategy. By dispersing data leaders across business units, Red Hat could simultaneously deploy an enterprise-wide solution while creating a data culture across the company.









As data leaders, our role is to help shift and transform—to not let up on the gas pedal when it comes to building a data culture. I think it’s our job as data practitioners to influence corporate culture to be more data-driven.



          Heidi Lanford, 
Former Vice President, Enterprise Data and Analytics











This focus on collaboration has evolved into a focus on internal community, supported through several community engagement activities. First, Red Hat has Project Owners—cross-functional advocates for Tableau adoption who drive consistency across enterprise processes and business reporting. They also spearhead internal chat channels and local meetups, so people can discuss visualizations or provide feedback. The Tableau Enablement Lead focuses on expanding the Red Hat community, tapping into data enthusiasts to lead events, providing training, and offering expertise as an “on call” consultant. These activities increased the number of employees—both practitioners and leaders— using data to guide decisions to a current total of more than 4,500 Tableau users. A broader self-service model coupled with a focus on enabling the community of users and consumers is expected to drive consistency and grow trust in the information shared and consumed.








      Tableau adoption doubles in three months, exceeding expectations and driving cost and time savings
      

Red Hat’s data sources varied; there were more than 60, including Google Sheets, Excel, and other operations platforms. Together they created noise and made it challenging to uncover critical information. “That’s at the core of what we’re trying to bring; access to information that matters, as soon as possible,” stated Mandy Elliott, Chief of Staff and Strategy. Migrating workloads to the cloud, they needed a resilient analytics platform that all employees could use, which required little-to-no server maintenance or monitoring. The Enterprise Data and Analytics team was looking to lessen the need to maintain an on-premise deployment because of the staffing, time, and financial resources. As a fully hosted solution, Tableau Online required no server configuration so they didn’t have to manage upgrades and the team can seamlessly add users as they grow.









Tableau Online gives us an opportunity to bring different facets of our organization together. And the ease with which we’ve been able to give that to Red Hatters across the globe and in different functions has helped speed up and create a community groundswell.



          Wes Gelpi, 
Senior Manager, Business Intelligence and Analytics










The synergy and trust that grew from sharing dashboards on Tableau Online created organic analytics growth and tripled the user base. With data in people’s hands, Red Hat has improved its processes, operations, staffing, and customer service. As Mandy summarized, taking these steps of new skill sets, enhanced processes, and better ways of working together, has started to make an impact on the global organization.








      Data proficiency evolves from literacy program
      

Red Hat is implementing programs to motivate and change how leaders, managers, and associates approach data. Red Hat’s data literacy program combines product training with specialized curriculum and enablement activities to build up skills like critical thinking and basic data knowledge. They even have a specialized track for data champions, who have the added responsibility to change mindsets and encourage data-informed decision making. “These data champions will help lift our data culture at Red Hat,” shared Mandy. This commitment is shaping how people approach data at all levels, functions, and locations. Tableau use is closely monitored by the Enablement Lead together with the Enterprise Data and Analytics team. They look at data around dashboard usage from different business units and across regions to inform when and how trainings and community activities are offered and aligned to meet user needs. This usage information also sparks conversations around data insights and observations.


















      Red Hat prioritizes Tableau reporting for leaders
      

To minimize the time and resources previously spent to manually develop weekly, monthly, and quarterly executive reports, the Enterprise Data and Analytics team facilitated development of key performance dashboards in Tableau to increase performance visibility. But first, they worked closely with business leaders across all functional areas to ensure that meaningful data was included and reported accurately. They held personalized adoption workshops with C-suite executives to understand how they use data to help inform the design and content for the dashboards. Upon release of the Executive Dashboard, they saw leaders logging in multiple times each week, sometimes nearly a dozen times a week. They saw an increase in trust in the data, which led to more everyday data use in meetings and in individual work. “Tableau provided our data and analytics professionals an avenue to work together more effectively, and we expect the power of those cross-functional insights will aid us in reaching our business goals,” concluded Mandy.









Tableau is flexible and meets users’ needs, but can also pivot when a user has a question. To me, Tableau is one of the few solutions I’ve observed which enables that at the speed of innovation.

Red Hat helps customers integrate new and existing  applications, develop cloud-native applications, standardize industry-leading operating systems, and automate, secure, and manage complex environments. Growing at an accelerated rate, Red Hat used a variety of business intelligence tools in isolated situations, but lacked a coordinated approach to their enterprise analytics. With a disconnected data strategy, leaders found it complicated to see the big picture as they made key business decisions. Global staff, particularly data analysts and data engineers, also struggled to make connections among siloed data. They needed an analytics platform that spanned multiple sources, ensured agile performance, and enabled cloud-based collaboration. Red Hat decommissioned several other business intelligence platforms and replaced them with a SaaS solution—Tableau Online, combined with Tableau Blueprint to guide their deployment strategy. Focusing on the pillars of community and proficiency, Red Hat scaled from 50 Tableau users to more than 4,500 in the first year, doubling adoption expectations in the first three months. By shifting away from multiple tools, associates were better armed with insights to make quick, confident decisions that improved performance and results. They continue to grow engagement opportunities and training, spearheaded by a new role called the Tableau Enablement Lead, part of the Enterprise Data and Analytics team, along with Tableau advocates, referred to as Project Owners, who implement and share dashboard best practices as members of the Red Hat Tableau community.      Creating data-driven processes to support 4,500+ employees, guided by Tableau Blueprint      When Red Hat adopted Tableau, they used Tableau Blueprint to guide their deployment journey. “Blueprint demonstrated to us how Tableau approaches governance to enable speed, and that isn’t something we saw before,” explained Wes Gelpi, Senior Manager of Business Intelligence & Analytics. Blueprint helped analytics leadership set clear expectations and processes for governance, proficiency, collaboration, and more. “Tableau Blueprint enabled us to deploy more effectively and it changed how we think about Tableau going forward,” added Wes.      Building out strategy and teams to grow community and nurture data leadersThe first order of business was building out the right strategy and teams, which included a new organizational model aligning resources to business areas and documenting their enterprise data strategy. By dispersing data leaders across business units, Red Hat could simultaneously deploy an enterprise-wide solution while creating a data culture across the company.As data leaders, our role is to help shift and transform—to not let up on the gas pedal when it comes to building a data culture. I think it’s our job as data practitioners to influence corporate culture to be more data-driven.          Heidi Lanford, Former Vice President, Enterprise Data and AnalyticsThis focus on collaboration has evolved into a focus on internal community, supported through several community engagement activities. First, Red Hat has Project Owners—cross-functional advocates for Tableau adoption who drive consistency across enterprise processes and business reporting. They also spearhead internal chat channels and local meetups, so people can discuss visualizations or provide feedback. The Tableau Enablement Lead focuses on expanding the Red Hat community, tapping into data enthusiasts to lead events, providing training, and offering expertise as an “on call” consultant. These activities increased the number of employees—both practitioners and leaders— using data to guide decisions to a current total of more than 4,500 Tableau users.

Governance
Create trust and confidence with controls, roles, and processes












Governance is central to Tableau Blueprint because it makes self-service possible—enabling, rather than restricting, access to trusted data and content. Governance will help to drive all decisions as the project team develops agility, proficiency, and community across the organization. Defining the right balance of flexibility and control will help you build a foundation for every data-driven decision, establishing trust and confidence to drive business value.
















Watch to learn how customizable governance capabilities in Tableau build trust and confidence in self-service analytics at scale. Ensure the responsible use of data at any skill level with the highly configurable Tableau platform.
Watch Now
























Data Governance

You'll define policies and procedures to ensure that the right data is available to the right people in the organization, at the time they need it. Striking the balance between control and agility means you can enable everyone in your organization to get the answers they need while ensuring security is enforced.
This topic covers:




Data source management
Data quality
Enrichment and preparation




Data security
Metadata management
Monitoring and management



Continue








Content Governance

You'll develop repeatable processes to manage analytical content and encourage a thriving modern analytics program. This includes establishing policies to keep the content in your environment relevant and fresh—such as knowing when to decommission content because it’s not getting the expected traffic, or finding out why no one is using an important dashboard for decision-making.
This topic covers:




Content management
Authorization
Content validation




Content promotion
Content certification
Content utilization



Continue








Governance Models

Considering your various use cases, policies, and overall business needs, you'll right-size data and content governance to one or more of three primary models—centralized, delegated, and self-governing. You can tailor areas within data and content governance to meet your unique requirements, from soft guidelines to firm boundaries for using Tableau. As people grow their analytical capabilities, you can delegate more responsibilities over time.
This topic covers:




Centralized model— IT or a central BI team owns data access and produces data sources and dashboards for the business in a one-to-many manner.
Delegated model— New roles help to strengthen collaboration between IT and business users, increasing analytical skills and self-sufficiency.
Self-governing model— Content processes are defined and understood, allowing fluid boundaries between consuming, creating, and promoting content.





Continue




















“Allowing self-service in one of the most highly regulated spaces—having the standard platform, the right data controls and the right governance in the tool that captures metadata and provides lineage of it in Tableau—users love it because they don’t have to wait for IT and IT loves it because they have happy users.”


        Sriram Belur, Head of Business Intelligence Delivery Center, JPMorgan Chase























“Our definition of governance, of how we look at data, has altered in a way. It used to be self-service—get whatever data you want, but we can’t guarantee where it came from—to now building standards and consistency around it.”


     Daniel Trimmer, Senior Manager of Product Facing Solutions, Abercrombie

The Modern Analytics Workflow empowers people to ask and answer their own questions with data, enables people to easily share their insights with their team and the rest of the organization, and ensures that the data supporting their decisions is accurate, trusted, and secure. The workflow is comprised of five key actions: Access & View, Interact, Analyze & Discover, Share, and Promote & Govern. 



Modern Analytics Workflow
 
The actions of the Modern Analytics Workflow are executed by the following roles:

IT and/or BI Professionals — Tableau Server Administrators install, manage, monitor, and maintain a Tableau deployment. Server Administrators, or by delegation to Site Administrators, perform user provisioning, maintain security and permissions, and provide governance oversight. For Tableau Online, IT Professionals will integrate with your existing technology investments, such as authentication and data connectivity, while Tableau Online Site Administrators will perform user provisioning, maintain security and permissions, and provide governance oversight. In both Tableau Server and Tableau Online, administration can be scoped to the project level using Project Leader permissions.
Content Creators — Tableau Creators are licensed with Tableau Prep Builder, Tableau Desktop, and full Tableau Server or Tableau Online authoring capabilities, including connecting to data, to create content. Tableau Explorers perform all authoring within Web Authoring with existing content. Site Administrators and Tableau Creators or Tableau Explorers with the appropriate permissions can validate, promote, and certify content. 
Information Consumers — Tableau Viewers access, view, and interact with content in Tableau Server or Tableau Online, including desktop, tablet, and phone. Server and Site Administrators, Creators, and Explorers can consume content as well.

With increasing analytical skills, the boundaries between these roles become more fluid as someone can switch from consuming to creating to promoting content, assuming the appropriate license and permissions.

Governance in Tableau is a critical step to driving usage and adoption of analytics while maintaining security and integrity of the data. You must define standards, processes, and policies to securely manage data and content through the Modern Analytics Workflow. Just as important as defining these is having everyone in the workflow understand and comply so that users will have trust and confidence in the analytics they’ll use to make data-driven decisions. 
To define your organization’s Tableau Governance Models, you should work through the areas of data and content governance that are outlined in the diagram below using the Tableau Blueprint Planner.



 
Data Governance in Tableau
The purpose of data governance in the Modern Analytics Workflow is to ensure that the right data is available to the right people in the organization, at the time they need it. It creates accountability and enables, rather than restricts, access to secure and trusted content and for users of all skill levels.
Data Source Management
Data source management includes processes related to selection and distribution of data within your organization. Tableau connects to your enterprise data platforms and leverages the governance you already have applied to those systems. In a self-service environment, content authors and data stewards have the ability to connect to various data sources, build and publish data sources, workbooks, and other content. Without these processes, there will be a proliferation of duplicate data sources, which will cause confusion among users, increase likelihood of errors, and consume system resources. 
Tableau’s hybrid data architecture provides two modes for interacting with data, using a live query or an in-memory extract. Switching between the two is as easy as selecting the right option for your use case. In both live and extract use cases, users may connect to your existing data warehouse tables, views, and stored procedures to leverage those with no additional work.  
Live queries are appropriate if you have invested in a fast database, need up-to-the-minute data, or use Initial SQL. In-memory extracts should be used if your database or network is too slow for interactive queries, to take load off transactional databases, or when offline data access is required. 
With support for a new multi-table logical layer and relationships in Tableau 2020.2, users aren’t limited to using data from a single, flat, denormalized table in a Tableau Data Source. They can now build multi-table data sources with flexible, LOD-aware relationships between tables, without having to specify join types in anticipation of what questions can be asked of the data. With multi-table support, Tableau data sources can now directly represent common enterprise data models such as star and snowflake schemas, as well as more complex, multi-fact models. Multiple levels of detail are supported in a single data source, so fewer data sources are needed to represent the same data.  Relationships are more flexible than database joins and can support additional use-cases as they arise, reducing the need to build new data models to answer new questions. Using relationships in well-modeled schemas can reduce both the time to create a data model as well as the number of data sources to answer business questions. For more information, see Metadata Management later in this section and The Tableau Data Model.
When publishing a workbook to Tableau Server or Tableau Online, the author will have a choice to publish the data source or leave it embedded in the workbook. The data source management processes you define will govern this decision. With Tableau Data Server, which is a built-in component of the Tableau platform, you can share and reuse data models, secure how your users access data, and manage and consolidate extracts with Published Data Sources. Further, Published Data Sources allow Tableau Creator- and Explorer-licensed users to have access to secure, trusted data in Tableau for web authoring and Ask Data.  For more information, see Best Practices for Published Data Sources, Edit Views on the Web, and Optimize Data for Ask Data. 
With increased data discovery capabilities, Tableau Catalog indexes all content, including workbooks, data sources, and flows to allow authors to search for fields, columns, databases, and tables in workbooks and published data sources.  For more information, see Data Management Add-on.
When Tableau Catalog is enabled, content authors can Search for Data by selecting from Data Sources, Databases and Files, or Tables to see if it exists in Tableau Server and Tableau Online and minimize duplication of data sources.



In addition, the Data Details tab on a view published to Tableau Server and Tableau Online will provide consumers with relevant information about the data used in it. Details include information about the workbook (name, author, date modified), the data sources used in the view, and a list of the fields in use.



For data stewards who create new Published Data Sources, the workflow below shows the two major decision points that impact data source management—live or extract and embedded or shared data model. This is not to imply that a formal modeling process must always occur before analysis begins.






To discover and prioritize key sources of data, use the Tableau Data and Analytics Survey and Tableau Use Cases and Data Sources tabs in the Tableau Blueprint Planner.
 

Key Considerations for Data Source Management

What are the key sources of data for a department or team?
Who is the data steward or owner of the data?
Will you connect live or extract the data?
Should the data source be embedded or published?
Do variants of a dataset exist? If so, can they be consolidated as an authoritative source?
If multiple data sources are consolidated, does the single data source performance or utility suffer by attempting to fulfill too many use cases at once?
What business questions need to be answered by the data source?
What naming conventions are used for Published Data Sources?

 

Data Quality
Data quality is a measure of data's fitness to serve its purpose in a given context—in this case, for making business decisions. The quality of data is determined by factors such as accuracy, completeness, reliability, relevance, and freshness. You likely already have processes in place to ensure data quality as it is ingested from source systems, and the more that is fixed in upstream processes, the less correction will be needed at the time of analysis. You should ensure data quality is consistent all the way through to consumption. 
As you are planning, it is a good time to review existing upstream data quality checks because data will be available to a larger group of users under a self-service model. In addition, Tableau Prep Builder and Tableau Desktop are great tools for detecting data quality issues. By establishing a process to report data quality issues to the IT team or data steward, the data quality will become an integral part of building trust and confidence in the data. 
With the Tableau Data Management Add-on and Tableau Catalog, you should communicate data quality issues to your users to increase visibility and trust in the data. When a problem exists, you can set a warning message on a data asset so that users of that data asset are aware of particular issues. For example, you might want to let users know that the data hasn't been refreshed in two weeks or that a data source has been deprecated. You can set one data quality warning per data asset, such as a data source, database, flow, or table. For more information, see Set a Data Quality Warning, including the following types: Warning, Deprecated, Stale Data, and Under Maintenance.



Note that you can set a data quality warning using REST API. For more information, see Add Data Quality Warning in the Tableau REST API Help.

Key Considerations for Data Quality

What processes exist for ensuring accuracy, completeness, reliability, and relevance?
Have you developed a checklist to operationalize the process?
Who needs to review data prior to it becoming shared and trusted?
Is your process adaptable to business users and are they able to partner with data owners to report issues?

 

Enrichment & Preparation
Enrichment and preparation include the processes used to enhance, refine, or prepare raw data for analysis. Often a single data source does not answer all the questions a user may have. Adding data from different sources adds valuable context. You likely already have ETL processes to clean, combine, aggregate, and store data when ingesting raw data from various sources. With command line interfaces and APIs, Tableau can be integrated with your existing processes.
For self-service data preparation, Tableau Prep Builder and Tableau Prep Conductor,  should be used to combine multiple sources of data and automate on a schedule. Tableau Prep has multiple output types to Tableau Server or Tableau Online, including CSV, Hyper, and TDE, or Published Data Sources. Beginning with 2020.3, Tableau Prep outputs include database tables, 
		where the result of a flow can be saved to a table in a relational database. This means that prepped data from Tableau Prep Builder can be stored and governed in a central location and leveraged throughout your organization. Tableau Prep Builder is part of the Tableau Creator license, while Tableau Prep Conductor is part of the Tableau Data Management Add-On. Tableau Data Management helps you better manage the data within your analytics environment from data preparation to cataloging, search, and governance, ensuring that trusted and up-to-date data is always used to drive decisions.
With visual, smart, direct feedback at every step, Tableau Prep Builder will help users to prototype and prepare disparate sources of data for analysis. Once the steps are defined and verified, the flow should be published to Tableau Server and Tableau Online where Prep Conductor will execute the flow and output a Published Data Source on the specified schedule. Automation creates a consistent process, reduces error-prone manual steps, tracks success/failure, and saves time. Users will have confidence in the output because the steps can be viewed on Tableau Server or Tableau Online.
 



Tableau Prep Flow



Tableau Prep Flow in Tableau Server or Tableau Online

Key Considerations for Data Enrichment

Will data enrichment and preparation be centralized or self-service?
What organizational roles perform data enrichment and preparation? 
What ETL tools and processes should be used to automate enrichment and/or preparation?
What sources of data provide valuable context when combined with each other?
How complex are the data sources to be combined? 
Will users be able to use Tableau Prep Builder and/or Tableau Desktop to combine datasets?
Have standardized join or blend fields been established by the DBA to enable users to enrich and prepare datasets?
How will you enable self-service data preparation? 

 

Data Security
Data security is of utmost importance in every enterprise. Tableau allows customers to build upon their existing data security implementations. IT administrators have the flexibility to implement security within the database with database authentication, within Tableau with permissions, or a hybrid approach of both. Security will be enforced regardless of whether users are accessing the data from published views on the web, on mobile devices, or through Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder. Customers often favor the hybrid approach for its flexibility to handle different kinds of use cases. Start by establishing a data security classification to define the different types of data and levels of sensitivity that exist in your organization.
When leveraging database security, it is important to note that the method chosen for authentication to the database is key. This level of authentication is separate from the Tableau  authentication (i.e. when a user logs into Tableau, he or she is not yet logging into the database). This means that Tableau users will also need to have credentials (their own username/password or service account username/password) to connect to the database for the database-level security to apply. To further protect your data, Tableau only needs read-access credentials to the database, which prevents publishers from accidentally changing the underlying data. Alternatively, in some cases, it is useful to give the database user permission to create temporary tables. This can have both performance and security advantages because the temporary data is stored in the database rather than in Tableau. 
In addition, extract encryption at rest is a data security feature that allows you to encrypt .hyper extracts while they are stored on Tableau Server. Available as of 2019.3, Tableau Server administrators can enforce encryption of all extracts on their site or enable users to encrypt all extracts associated with particular published workbooks or data sources. For more information, see Extract Encryption at Rest. Tableau Online is already fully encrypted at rest.
You can limit which users see what data by setting user filters on data sources. This allows you to better control what data users see in a published view based on their Tableau login account. Using this technique, a regional manager can view data for her region but not the data for the other regional managers. With these data security approaches, you can publish a single view or dashboard in a way that provides secure, personalized data and analysis to a wide range of users on Tableau. For more information, see Data Security and Restrict Access at the Data Row Level.

Key Considerations for Data Security

How do you classify different types of data according to its sensitivity?
How does someone request access to data?
Will you use a service account or database security to connect to data? 
What is the appropriate approach to secure data according to sensitivity classification?
Does your data security meet legal, compliance, and regulatory requirements?

 



Metadata Management
Metadata management includes policies and processes that ensure information can be accessed, shared, analyzed and maintained across the organization, as an extension of Data Source Management. Metadata is a business-friendly representation of data in common terms, similar to a semantic layer in traditional BI platforms. Curated data sources hide the complexity of your organization’s modern data architecture and make fields immediately understandable regardless of the data store and table from which it was sourced.

Tableau employs a simple, elegant, and powerful metadata system that gives users flexibility while allowing for enterprise metadata management. The Tableau Data Model can be embedded in a workbook or centrally managed as a Published Data Source with Data Server. After connecting to data and creating the Tableau Data Model, which will become a Published Data Source on Tableau Server or Tableau Online, look at it from your users’ perspective and see how much easier analytics will be when they have a well-formatted starting point, filtered and sized to the business questions it can answer. For more information on Published Data Sources, visit The Tableau Data Model, Best Practices for Published Data Sources and Enabling Governed Data Access with Tableau Data Server.
The diagram below shows where elements exist in the Tableau Data Model:



Beginning in 2020.2, the Data Source includes the connection, connection attributes, and the physical and logical layers within a Data Model. Upon connection, Tableau automatically characterizes fields as dimensions or measures. In addition, the Data Model stores calculations, aliases, and formatting. The physical layer includes physical tables defined by joins, unions, and/or custom SQL. Each group of one or more physical tables defines a logical table, which resides in the logical layer along with relationships.
Relationships are a new way to model data that is more flexible than using joins. A relationship describes how two tables relate to each other, based on common fields, but it does not combine the tables together as the result of a join does. Relationships provide several advantages over using joins.


You don't need to configure join types between tables. You only need to select the fields to define the relationship.

Relationships use joins, but they are automatic. Relationships postpone the selection of join types to the time and context of analysis.

Tableau uses relationships to automatically generate correct aggregations and appropriate joins during analysis, based on the current context of the fields in use in a worksheet.

Multiple tables at different levels of detail are supported in a single data source, so fewer data sources are needed to represent the same data.

Unmatched measure values are not dropped (no accidental loss of data).

Tableau will generate queries only for the data that is relevant to the current view.


At run-time in the VizQL model, multiple queries are built dynamically based on the dimensions and measures of the visualization and filters, aggregations, and table calculations are applied. Tableau uses the contextual information of the separate logical table to determine what joins are applied to provide the correct aggregation.  This enables one user to design the Data Source without needing to know, plan, or otherwise account for all the variations of analysis to be performed with the Data Source by other users. Tableau Catalog discovers and indexes all of the content on Tableau, including workbooks, data sources, sheets, and flows.
Data stewards or authors with direct access to sources of data should prototype data sources as an embedded data source in a Tableau workbook and then create a Published Data Source in Tableau to share the curated Tableau Data Model, as shown below in the direct access workflow: 



If authors do not have direct access to sources of data, they will rely on a DBA or data steward to provide the prototype data source embedded in a Tableau workbook. After reviewing and verifying it contains the needed data, a Site Administrator or Project Leader will create a Published Data Source in Tableau to share the Tableau Data Model, as shown below in the restricted access workflow: 



The metadata checklist identifies best practices for curating a Published Data Source. By establishing data standards using the checklist, you’ll enable the business with governed self-service data access that is user-friendly and easy to understand. Prior to creating an extract or Published Data Source in Tableau, review and apply the following checklist to the Tableau Data Model: 

Validate the data model
Filter and size to the analysis at hand
Use standard, user-friendly naming conventions
Add field name synonyms and custom suggestions for Ask Data
Create hierarchies (drill paths)
Set data types
Apply formatting (dates, numbers)
Set fiscal year start date, if applicable
Add new calculations
Remove duplicate or test calculations
Enter field descriptions as comments
Aggregate to highest level
Hide unused fields

Beginning in 2019.3 in the Data Management Add-on,Tableau Catalog discovers and indexes all of the content on Tableau, including workbooks, data sources, sheets, and flows. Indexing is used to gather information about the metadata, schemas, and lineage of the content. Then from the metadata, Tableau Catalog identifies all of the databases, files, and tables used by the content on your Tableau Server or Tableau Online site. Knowing where your data comes from is key to trusting the data, and knowing who else uses it means you can analyze the impact of changes data in your environment. The lineage feature in Tableau Catalog indexes both internal and external content. For more information, see Use Lineage for Impact Analysis.






Using lineage, you can trace down to content owners at the end of the lineage graph. The list of owners includes anyone assigned as the owner of a workbook, data source, or flow, and anyone assigned as the contact for a database or table in the lineage. If a change is going to be made, you can email owners to let them know about its impact. For more information, see Use email to contact owners.

Key Considerations for Metadata Management

What is the process for curating data sources?
Has the data source been sized to the analysis at hand?
What is your organizational standard for naming conventions and field formatting?
Does the Tableau Data Model meet all criteria for curation, including user-friendly naming conventions?
Has the metadata checklist been defined, published, and integrated into the validation, promotion, and certification processes?

 

Monitoring & Management
Monitoring is a critical piece of the self-service model as it allows IT and administrators to understand how data is being used and be proactive and responsive about usage, performance, data connectivity, and refresh failures. Depending on your company’s database standards, IT will use a combination of tools and job schedulers for ingesting and monitoring raw data and server health. 
Just as business users leverage data to make smarter decisions, administrators are also empowered to make data-driven decisions about their Tableau deployment. With Tableau Server’s default administrative views and custom administrative views, Tableau Server and Site Administrators will use default administrative views for monitoring the status of extract refreshes, data source utilization, and delivery of subscriptions and alerts. Custom administrative views are created from Tableau Server's repository data. In Tableau Online, Site Administrators have access to Monitor Site Activity with default administrative views and can Use Admin Insights to Create Custom Views. For more information, see Tableau Monitoring and the Measurement of Tableau User Engagement and Adoption.

Key Considerations for Monitoring & Management

Are schedules available for the times needed for extract refreshes?
How is raw data ingestion monitored from source systems? Did the jobs complete successfully?
Are there duplicate sources of data?
When are extract refreshes scheduled to run? How long do extracts run on server? Did the refresh succeed or fail? 
Are subscription schedules available after extract refreshes have occurred?
Are data sources being used? By whom? How does this compare with the expected audience size?
What is the process to remove stale Published Data Sources?

 

Data Governance Summary
Striking the balance between control and agility is critical. In spite of stringent governance policies, users often go the route of locally saving sensitive data and analytics for quick analysis. In a self-service environment, the role of data governance is to permit access to data and enable users to get the answers they need while ensuring security is enforced. Although every organization has different requirements, the table below describes the ideal state for governing self-service data access:

Content Governance in Tableau
As the use of analytics increases, a growing number of mission-critical business decisions will become data-driven. The net effect is not only an increase in content volume but also in the varying skill levels among its users who will be collaborating and uncovering valuable insights. With more and more people using data daily, it is critical that Tableau content can be secured, governed, and trusted—as well as organized so that people can discover, consume, and create content with confidence. Without content governance, users will find it increasingly difficult to find what they need among irrelevant, stale, or duplicate workbooks and data sources.
Content governance involves the processes that keep content relevant and fresh, such as knowing when to decommission content because it’s not getting the expected traffic or finding out why no one is using an important dashboard for decision-making. The responsibility of ensuring compliance with an organization’s content governance policies is a core responsibility of content authors. 
This section provides IT administrators and business users with the core concepts underpinning Tableau’s content governance features and guidance on how these concepts should be applied to manage the content created in a thriving modern analytics platform.


Content Management
Defining a consistent content organization structure allows administrators to manage content and makes content more discoverable by users. Tableau Server and Tableau Online give you the flexibility needed to structure your environment and manage content based your specific governance requirements. Thoughtfully structuring your site will help you deliver true self-service analytics at scale and ensure the responsible use of data to enable your users to discover and share insights.
Projects
To share and collaborate, users will create and publish content to a project in Tableau Server or Tableau Online. Projects are the default containers used to organize and secure content, holding workbooks, data sources, flows, metrics, and other nested projects within them. This creates a scalable structure for managing access to the content published to Tableau.
Organizations are not flat, and neither is the way you govern your content. Projects and nested projects behave much like file system folders to provide hierarchical structures that gather related data and content with the users, groups, and corresponding permissions that mirror your business. Only administrators can create top-level projects, but it is easy to delegate nested projects to Project Owners or Project Leaders for their specific needs. Common content management approaches include organizational (by department/team), functional (by topic), or hybrid (combination of organizational and functional). When planning the content structure, the cross-functional Tableau team should establish consistent naming conventions for project and the groups who will have access to them.
For example, in the initial Tableau Server deployment, the Sales, Marketing, and IT departments will be onboarded. Following the organizational structure, top-level projects for each will be created for every department. The users in these three departments, also happen to be part of the cross-functional Digital Transformation team. Because digital transformation content spans multiple departments’ users, a separate project named Digital Transformation will also be needed. The users from each of their respective departments will be part of a group who can access them. Users and groups only see projects to which they have access, so do not be concerned with the number of projects that you see as an administrator.



Sandbox and Certified Projects
To support self-service, sandbox and production projects should be used. Sandbox projects contain ad hoc or uncertified content, and production projects contain validated, certified content. Users should understand the difference in purpose between these two project types. All content authors with access to a sandbox project can freely explore data, author content, and perform ad hoc analysis. The production project’s validated and certified content means that there is a high degree of trust and confidence in it for data-driven decision making.
Publishing to the production project is limited to a small group of users who will validate, promote, and certify content for this location. These content management tasks should be delegated to users who are Project Owners and Project Leaders. For more information, see Project Level Administration (Tableau Server | Tableau Online). The roles and the process of content validation, promotion, and certification are described later in this topic.
The diagram below shows the Sales department’s project hierarchy with a  Sales Department Data Sources project, which holds department-wide data sources. The nested projects within the Sales department’s project map to sales regions. Groups corresponding to the users within each region have access to the appropriate regional nested projected. The content created by the regions will exist alongside nested projects within them, which will be used to organize and secure it as needed. Beginning with your organizational structure is an appropriate place to begin mapping out your Tableau content structure because departments likely already have security, data, and application access that correspond with their job functions.



As a department-team example, Marketing branches out to accommodate shared resources such as department wide production content and data sources, but then lock down specific resources for a group such as Digital which has its own production and sandbox projects. The Marketing project hierarchy is shown below.



Permissions should be managed at the project level using locked projects and groups to enforce governed access to content and simplify administration.  While it is possible to manage permissions at an item level with unlocked projects, they will quickly become unwieldly to manage.  Locked projects secure data while providing collaboration across projects when you need it.  For more information, see Use Projects to Manage Content Access (Windows | Linux).
With the introduction of locked nested projects in 2020.1, a project can be locked at any level in the project hierarchy regardless of whether the parent is locked with different permissions. Tableau Server and Site Administrators and Tableau Online Site Administrators can manage content and permissions more effectively by delegating content management responsibilities to Project Owners or Project Leaders, who are closer to the work. They will use the locked nested projects with the permissions model that meet their specific group needs at any level in the hierarchy.



Check Apply to nested projects to lock nested projects independently.
Collections

Collections, introduced in 2021.2, provide a virtual container for content. Think of Collections as a playlist like you would find in Spotify, giving you the ability to curate the combination of content you want to share with others. This functionality differs from Favoriting, which you can not share with others.
Getting started with Collections is easy and available for any Tableau user site role.
You can add most content types (e.g. Workbooks, Views, Metrics, Datasources, etc.) to a collection from anywhere across a single site regardless of its project location. It’s a flexible way to onboard new team members, support your workflows, and share related content without moving or duplicating existing items.  Item permissions are still enforced so only the appropriate users will see and have access to content that’s in the collection.
There are many ways to use Collections as part of your organization’s content management framework. Continuing the example above, imagine that your organization has multiple projects (Sales and Marketing). You want to give users the ability to easily find related content from across these projects so you create a Collection. Now teams can easily weave a complete picture around a topic from one place.
Personal Sandbox
To provide a place for all individuals to securely save their work on Tableau Server or Tableau Online, you should create a single personal sandbox and permissions to restrict content owners to only viewing their own items. The personal sandbox can be used for ad hoc or in-progress analysis and hides the content that is not ready for broad release.  When ready, users can move their content to the department sandbox for validation, promotion, and certification process. A single personal sandbox for all users reduces administrative overhead by reducing the number of projects to secure and manage. After creating a top-level project named “Personal Sandbox,” set the permissions on the project for All Users to Publish, None for workbooks, and None for data sources, None for Flows, and None for Metrics.



Publisher only permissions at the Project level only
With personal sandbox content in a single location, administrators can monitor how often content is viewed, suggest when owners should delete stale content, and check who is making the most use of the personal sandbox. Content owners can always see the content they own, even if it is published in a project where they are denied the ability to view workbooks and data sources. Authorization is explained in more detail in the next section.
Sites
Both Tableau Server and Tableau Online support multi-tenancy using sites. In Tableau Server, you can create multiple sites to establish a security boundary that isolates specific users, groups, data, and content on the same Tableau Server deployment. Users of one site do not have access to another site, including visibility of its existence. Because of the strict boundaries, sites work well when there is a deliberate need to prevent users from collaborating, or when content can remain separate during all phases of development.
For example, the diagram below shows two Tableau Server sites. In this example, unique users in Site 1 have no access to Site 2 including data and content. A user with access to both Site 1 and Site 2 can only sign into one site at a time. If some content is needed by both sites’ users, it will need to be duplicated within each site, or a new site will need to be created for the shared content for these users, which creates a lot more administrative overhead to monitor, measure, and maintain. In Tableau Online, your instance of Tableau is a single site.



Sites create hard boundaries (see diagram above)
Sites in Tableau Server may initially appear to be a useful construct for segmenting data sources, workbooks, and users, but the security boundary prohibits collaboration and content promotion that most organizations need for true self-service at scale. For this reason, carefully consider the implications of using sites instead of projects in a single site with delegated content management responsibilities. To illustrate the hard boundaries across sites, when you stand up a new site, relevant data sources need to be re-created in the new instance.
New sites should only be created when you need to manage a unique set of users and their content separately from all other Tableau users and content because content is purposefully not shareable across the boundaries. For more information and examples of when it makes sense to use sites, see Sites Overview (Windows | Linux).

Key Considerations for Content Management

Will workbooks and data sources be shared across the company?
Will sites be used to isolate sensitive content or departments?
Will projects use an organizational (departments/teams), functional (topics), or hybrid approach?
Have sandbox and production projects been setup to support ad-hoc and validated content?
Are content naming conventions used? 
Are authors publishing multiple copies of the same workbook with different filters selected?
Does content have a description, tags, and comply with visual styles?
Do you have a load time expectation and an exception procedure in place?
After employees leave the company, what is the process to reassign content ownership?

 

Authorization
When a user attempts to login to Tableau, authentication verifies a user’s identity. Everyone who needs access to Tableau Server must be represented as a user in Tableau Server’s identity store (Windows | Linux). Tableau Online Authentication supports Tableau, Google, and SAML to verify a user's identity. Authorization refers to how and what users can access on Tableau Server and Tableau Online after the user has been authenticated. Authorization includes:

What users are allowed to do with content hosted in Tableau Server and Tableau Online, including site, projects, workbooks, views, data sources, and flows.
What tasks users are allowed to perform to administer Tableau Server and Tableau Online, such as configuring server and site settings, running command line tools, creating sites, and other tasks.

Authorization for these actions is managed by Tableau Server and Tableau Online and determined by a combination of the user's license type, site role, and permissions associated with specific entities such as workbooks and data sources. Tableau’s role-based licenses have implicit governance built in because of the capabilities that are included with them. For more information on specific capabilities by each license, see Tableau for Teams and Organizations.
When you add users to a site on Tableau Server or Tableau Online, independent of their license type, you must apply a site role to them. The site role signifies the maximum level of access a user can have on the site. 
Users with a Tableau Creator license have access to Tableau Server or Tableau Online, Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep Builder, and Tableau Mobile. The following site roles use a Tableau Creator license:




Site Role


Description






Server Administrator


Available on Tableau Server only; not applicable to Tableau Online.
Configure settings for the Tableau Server, all sites on the server, users and groups, and all content assets, such as projects, data sources (including connection information), workbooks, and flows.
Connect to Tableau Published Data Sources or external data from the browser, Tableau Desktop, or Tableau Prep Builder; create and publish new data sources and flows; author and publish workbooks.




Site Administrator Creator


Unrestricted access to content as described above, but at the site level. Connect to Tableau or external data in the browser, Tableau Desktop, or Tableau Prep Builder; create new data sources; build and publish content.
On Tableau Server, server administrators can determine whether to allow site administrators to manage users and assign site roles and site membership. By default, on Tableau Server, and always on Tableau Online, site administrators are allowed these capabilities.
This is the highest level of access for Tableau Online. Site Administrators have access to Site configuration settings.




Creator


Connect to data to author new data sources and dashboards, which are published and shared on Tableau Server and Tableau Online. Data stewards (DBA or data analyst) publish data sources. Creators incorporate process definitions, policies, guidelines, and business knowledge for enterprise metadata management in compliance with organizational and/or regulatory obligations.
 




 
Users with a Tableau Explorer license have access to Tableau Server or Tableau Online and Tableau Mobile. The following site roles use a Tableau Explorer license:




Site Role


Description






Site Administrator Explorer


Same access to site and user configuration as Site Administrator Creator but cannot connect to external data from the web editing environment.
Connect to Tableau Published Data Sources to create new workbooks and edit and save existing workbooks.




Explorer (Can Publish)


Publish new content from browser, browse and interact with published views, use all interaction features. In the web editing environment, can edit and save existing workbooks, and save new standalone data sources from data connections embedded in workbooks, but cannot connect to external data and create new data sources.




Explorer


Browse and interact with published views. Can subscribe to content, create data driven alerts, connect to Tableau Published Data Sources and open workbooks in the web authoring environment for ad-hoc queries, but they cannot save their work.
 




 
Users with a Tableau Viewer license have access to Tableau Server or Tableau Online and Tableau Mobile. 




Site Role


Description






Viewer


View and interact with filters and content. Viewers can also receive alerts triggered by business events.




 
Users who have been added to Tableau Server or Tableau Online but without a license are Unlicensed.




Site Role


Description






Unlicensed


Unlicensed users cannot sign in to Tableau Server or Tableau Online.
 




 
Site roles along with content permissions determines who can publish, interact with, or only view published content, as well as who can manage the site’s users and administer the site itself. The project team should work together to define the content permissions model. Tableau Server and/or Site Administrators will assign permission rules to groups and lock them to the project. Locked projects enforce permission rules on all content within the container, including nested projects. For more information, see Set Project Default Permissions and Lock the Project.
Tableau has default permission rules for projects, workbooks, and data sources, or you can define custom permission rules for these content types. 




Permission Rules Template


Description






Project Leader


Combined with the appropriate site role, allows the user or group full access to the project, its child projects, and content published into that project hierarchy.
 




Editor


Allows the user or group to connect to, edit, download, delete, and set permissions for data sources or workbooks in the project.
 
They can also publish data sources, and provided they are the owner of a data source they publish, can update connection information and extract refresh schedules. This permission is relevant for views when the view they access connects to a data source.
 




Publisher


Allows the user or group to publish workbooks and data sources to the project.
 




Connector


Allows the user or group to connect to data sources in the project.
 




Viewer


Allows the user or group to view the workbooks and views in the project.
 




None


Sets all capabilities for the permission rule to Unspecified.
 




Denied


Sets all capabilities for the permission rule to Denied.




 
Custom permissions allow more granularity in permissions—from accessing or downloading a data source to how a user interacts with published content. Tableau’s intuitive interface makes it easy to associate users to functional groups, assign permissions to the groups, and see who has access to which content. For more information, see Set Permissions on Individual Content Resources. If the Data Management Add-on is present, permissions for external assets have additional considerations. For more information, see Manage Permissions for External Assets.






You should create groups locally on the server or import from Active Directory/LDAP and synchronize (Windows | Linux) on a set schedule. Synchronization schedules are set by the Tableau Server Administrator or Tableau Online Site Administrators. To simplify maintenance, assign permissions to groups at the project level as shown below. For Tableau Online, you can Automate User Provisioning and Group Synchronization in Tableau Online through an External Identity Provider via SCIM and add or remove users or add or remove members from groups  using the REST API programmatically.
For more information, see Set-up Permissions Quick Start, Configure Projects, Groups, and Permissions for Managed Self-Service, and Permissions Reference. 
 

Key Considerations for Authorization

What is the minimum site role for Active Directory/LDAP or SCIM group synchronization?
Have you set all permissions for the All Users group in the Default project to None?
Are any explicit restrictions (Deny permissions) needed on the All Users group to propagate to every user account?
Have you created groups that correspond to a set of authoring and viewing capabilities for each project?
Have you reviewed effective permissions on select users to test your permissions model?
Have you locked permissions at the parent project to maintain security throughout the project hierarchy?
Have service account usernames/passwords been established for Published Data Sources?

 

Content Validation
Content validation is the first step in a series of events that will culminate in content certification. Similar to the data quality area in data governance, content validation encompasses the processes to validate that content is accurate, complete, reliable, relevant, and recent. 
The first role to validate content should be its author. Authors should solicit feedback from the target audience as well. This can be done in an informal feedback group or by sharing a link to the workbook. Data stewards should also play a role to ensure correctness and review an embedded data source as a potential candidate for publishing and certifying. If the data source is embedded in the workbook, the data steward should consider whether it is a potential candidate for publishing and certifying. Beyond data and calculation correctness, content validation should also include a review of the branding, layout, formatting, performance, filters, dashboard actions, and edge case behaviors by the Site Administrator or Project Leader site roles.

Key Considerations for Content Validation

Who is involved in the validation process?
Is the workbook accurate, complete, reliable, relevant, and recent?
Does the new content replace existing content?
Are the underlying data and calculations correct?
Does the workbook reflect corporate branding?
Does the workbook have a logical layout?
Are all axes and numbers formatted correctly?
Do dashboards load within the acceptable performance time?
Do filters and dashboard actions behave on the targeted views?
Does the dashboard remain useful in edge case behaviors (filtered to all, none, one value, etc.)?

 

Content Promotion
After content validation is complete, the process of content promotion is used to publish the workbook to a trusted project location or add the certification badge designation for Published Data Sources. An example of a workbook workflow is shown below.



Workbook Workflow
Content authors will connect to data, create new dashboards, and publish to the sandbox project. Site Administrators or Project Leaders will validate and approve the content. The approved content will be published to the production project. The Content Migration Tool, licensed as part of the Tableau Server Management Add-on, provides an easy way to promote or migrate content between Tableau Server projects. You can do this between projects on separate Tableau Server installations (for instance, between a development instance of Tableau Server and a product installation with appropriate licensing for each environment), or between projects on a single Tableau Server installation. The Content Migration Tool User Interface walks you through the steps necessary to build a ""migration plan"" that you can use a single time, or as a template for multiple migrations. To learn more about use cases, visit Content Migration Tool Use Cases.
If IT requirements mandate three separately licensed environments (Dev, QA, and Production), try not to replicate a traditional waterfall development cycle with a modern analytics platform. Users may favor the QA environment to circumvent stringent policies or delays to get content into production, so work towards a good balance by automating content migration to the production server with custom workflow scripts using Tableau’s REST APIs.

Key Considerations for Content Promotion

Who is involved in the promotion process?
Do content-promoting roles have a checklist of criteria to evaluate?
Have you clearly delineated between certified content and ad-hoc content by projects?
Is the process agile to support iterations and innovation?
Do you have workflows to address both direct and restricted sources of data and workbooks? 

 

Content Certification
After content has been validated and promoted, it achieves a trusted, certified status when a Site Administrator, Project Leader, or a Publisher (content author or data steward) with permission to the production project promotes the workbook or data source to the designated location. Certification makes content discoverable by content consumers and improves data stewards’ abilities to govern enterprise-wide data more effectively in Tableau by reducing the proliferation of duplicate workbooks and data sources.
Use the baseline requirements that were established in key considerations for content validation as the criteria for becoming certified. Content authors should have a clear understanding of how the certification process works from start to finish, and content consumers should know where certified content is published in the production project, as defined by your content management standards.
Data source certification enables data stewards to promote specific data sources in your Tableau deployment as trusted and ready for use. Certified Data Sources get preferential treatment in Tableau Server and Tableau Online search results and in our smart data source recommendations algorithm so that they are discoverable and easily reusable.


Certified Data Source

Key Considerations for Content Certification

Who is responsible for designating certified content?
Have all criteria for achieving certification status been met?
Are all fields completed: about, certification notes, tags?

 

Content Utilization
Content utilization is a measurement of the effective use of the data for business decisions, but the complete picture cannot be told through Traffic to Views alone. Measurement of content utilization helps your deployment to operate at scale and evolve by understanding user behaviors—who creates and consumes content, and the quality and relevance of the dashboards and data sources. If content isn’t being consumed, you will be able to identify it, and take the appropriate next steps.
Tableau Server Administrators and Tableau Online Site Administrators should monitor broad usage patterns with default administrative views. For more specific requirements, it is possible to create custom administrative views. For Tableau Server, this can be done with Tableau Server repository data.  In Tableau Online, Site Administrators have access to Monitor Site Activity with default administrative views and can Use Admin Insights to Create Custom Views.   Site Administrators should measure and audit usage of published content—both certified and ad-hoc—within their site. For example, if ad-hoc content utilization is significantly higher than certified content utilization, perhaps the promotion process is too restrictive or takes too long for business needs. 
Site Administrators should review content utilization in the context of the expected audience sizes that were documented on theTableau Use Cases and Data Sources tab of the Tableau Blueprint Planner. Individual content authors should also review utilization for their content in the sparkline tooltip by hovering over the workbook’s thumbnail or selecting Who Has Seen This View from the menu. For more information, see the Measurement of Tableau User Engagement and Adoption.

Key Considerations for Content Utilization

How much traffic goes to each view? 
What is the definition of stale content? How often is stale content purged?
How much indirect utilization (alerts & subscriptions) occurs?
Are subscriptions delivered on time?
Does the actual audience size match with expectations?
Does content follow a weekly, monthly, quarterly trend?
What is the frequency of login or days since last login by user cohort?
What is the distribution of workbook and data source size?

 Back to topThanks for your feedback!LegalPrivacy© 2003-2022 Tableau Software LLC. All rights reserved ","Governance in Tableau - Tableau Tableau Blueprint HelpVersion: Current  Governance in Tableau is a critical step to driving usage and adoption of analytics while maintaining security and integrity of the data. You must define standards, processes, and policies to securely manage data and content through the Modern Analytics Workflow. Just as important as defining these is having everyone in the workflow understand and comply so that users will have trust and confidence in the analytics they’ll use to make data-driven decisions. To define your organization’s Tableau Governance Models, you should work through the areas of data and content governance that are outlined in the diagram below using the Tableau Blueprint Planner. Data Governance in TableauThe purpose of data governance in the Modern Analytics Workflow is to ensure that the right data is available to the right people in the organization, at the time they need it. It creates accountability and enables, rather than restricts, access to secure and trusted content and for users of all skill levels.Data Source ManagementData source management includes processes related to selection and distribution of data within your organization. Tableau connects to your enterprise data platforms and leverages the governance you already have applied to those systems. In a self-service environment, content authors and data stewards have the ability to connect to various data sources, build and publish data sources, workbooks, and other content. Without these processes, there will be a proliferation of duplicate data sources, which will cause confusion among users, increase likelihood of errors, and consume system resources. Tableau’s hybrid data architecture provides two modes for interacting with data, using a live query or an in-memory extract. Switching between the two is as easy as selecting the right option for your use case. In both live and extract use cases, users may connect to your existing data warehouse tables, views, and stored procedures to leverage those with no additional work.  Live queries are appropriate if you have invested in a fast database, need up-to-the-minute data, or use Initial . In-memory extracts should be used if your database or network is too slow for interactive queries, to take load off transactional databases, or when offline data access is required. With support for a new multi-table logical layer and relationships in Tableau 2020.2, users aren’t limited to using data from a single, flat, denormalized table in a Tableau Data Source. They can now build multi-table data sources with flexible, -aware relationships between tables, without having to specify join types in anticipation of what questions can be asked of the data. With multi-table support, Tableau data sources can now directly represent common enterprise data models such as star and snowflake schemas, as well as more complex, multi-fact models. Multiple levels of detail are supported in a single data source, so fewer data sources are needed to represent the same data.  Relationships are more flexible than database joins and can support additional use-cases as they arise, reducing the need to build new data models to answer new questions. Using relationships in well-modeled schemas can reduce both the time to create a data model as well as the number of data sources to answer business questions. For more information, see Metadata Management later in this section and The Tableau Data Model.When publishing a workbook to Tableau Server or Tableau Online, the author will have a choice to publish the data source or leave it embedded in the workbook. The data source management processes you define will govern this decision. With Tableau Data Server, which is a built-in component of the Tableau platform, you can share and reuse data models, secure how your users access data, and manage and consolidate extracts with Published Data Sources. Further, Published Data Sources allow Tableau Creator- and Explorer-licensed users to have access to secure, trusted data in Tableau for web authoring and Ask Data.  For more information, see Best Practices for Published Data Sources, Edit Views on the Web, and Optimize Data for Ask Data. With increased data discovery capabilities, Tableau Catalog indexes all content, including workbooks, data sources, and flows to allow authors to search for fields, columns, databases, and tables in workbooks and published data sources.  For more information, see Data Management Add-on.When Tableau Catalog is enabled, content authors can Search for Data by selecting from Data Sources, Databases and Files, or Tables to see if it exists in Tableau Server and Tableau Online and minimize duplication of data sources.In addition, the Data Details tab on a view published to Tableau Server and Tableau Online will provide consumers with relevant information about the data used in it. Details include information about the workbook (name, author, date modified), the data sources used in the view, and a list of the fields in use.For data stewards who create new Published Data Sources, the workflow below shows the two major decision points that impact data source management—live or extract and embedded or shared data model. This is not to imply that a formal modeling process must always occur before analysis begins.To discover and prioritize key sources of data, use the Tableau Data and Analytics Survey and Tableau Use Cases and Data Sources tabs in the Tableau Blueprint Planner. Key Considerations for Data Source ManagementWhat are the key sources of data for a department or team?Who is the data steward or owner of the data?Will you connect live or extract the data?Should the data source be embedded or published?Do variants of a dataset exist? If so, can they be consolidated as an authoritative source?If multiple data sources are consolidated, does the single data source performance or utility suffer by attempting to fulfill too many use cases at once?What business questions need to be answered by the data source?What naming conventions are used for Published Data Sources? Data QualityData quality is a measure of data's fitness to serve its purpose in a given context—in this case, for making business decisions. The quality of data is determined by factors such as accuracy, completeness, reliability, relevance, and freshness. You likely already have processes in place to ensure data quality as it is ingested from source systems, and the more that is fixed in upstream processes, the less correction will be needed at the time of analysis. You should ensure data quality is consistent all the way through to consumption. As you are planning, it is a good time to review existing upstream data quality checks because data will be available to a larger group of users under a self-service model. In addition, Tableau Prep Builder and Tableau Desktop are great tools for detecting data quality issues. By establishing a process to report data quality issues to the  team or data steward, the data quality will become an integral part of building trust and confidence in the data. With the Tableau Data Management Add-on and Tableau Catalog, you should communicate data quality issues to your users to increase visibility and trust in the data. When a problem exists, you can set a warning message on a data asset so that users of that data asset are aware of particular issues. For example, you might want to let users know that the data hasn't been refreshed in two weeks or that a data source has been deprecated. You can set one data quality warning per data asset, such as a data source, database, flow, or table. For more information, see Set a Data Quality Warning, including the following types: Warning, Deprecated, Stale Data, and Under Maintenance.Note that you can set a data quality warning using  . For more information, see Add Data Quality Warning in the Tableau   Help.Key Considerations for Data QualityWhat processes exist for ensuring accuracy, completeness, reliability, and relevance?Have you developed a checklist to operationalize the process?Who needs to review data prior to it becoming shared and trusted?Is your process adaptable to business users and are they able to partner with data owners to report issues? Enrichment & PreparationEnrichment and preparation include the processes used to enhance, refine, or prepare raw data for analysis. Often a single data source does not answer all the questions a user may have. Adding data from different sources adds valuable context. You likely already have  processes to clean, combine, aggregate, and store data when ingesting raw data from various sources. With command line interfaces and s, Tableau can be integrated with your existing processes.For self-service data preparation, Tableau Prep Builder and Tableau Prep Conductor,  should be used to combine multiple sources of data and automate on a schedule. Tableau Prep has multiple output types to Tableau Server or Tableau Online, including , Hyper, and , or Published Data Sources. Beginning with 2020.3, Tableau Prep outputs include database tables, 		where the result of a flow can be saved to a table in a relational database. This means that prepped data from Tableau Prep Builder can be stored and governed in a central location and leveraged throughout your organization. Tableau Prep Builder is part of the Tableau Creator license, while Tableau Prep Conductor is part of the Tableau Data Management Add-On. Tableau Data Management helps you better manage the data within your analytics environment from data preparation to cataloging, search, and governance, ensuring that trusted and up-to-date data is always used to drive decisions.With visual, smart, direct feedback at every step, Tableau Prep Builder will help users to prototype and prepare disparate sources of data for analysis. Once the steps are defined and verified, the flow should be published to Tableau Server and Tableau Online where Prep Conductor will execute the flow and output a Published Data Source on the specified schedule. Automation creates a consistent process, reduces error-prone manual steps, tracks success/failure, and saves time. Users will have confidence in the output because the steps can be viewed on Tableau Server or Tableau Online. Tableau Prep FlowTableau Prep Flow in Tableau Server or Tableau OnlineKey Considerations for Data EnrichmentWill data enrichment and preparation be centralized or self-service?What organizational roles perform data enrichment and preparation? What  tools and processes should be used to automate enrichment and/or preparation?What sources of data provide valuable context when combined with each other?How complex are the data sources to be combined? Will users be able to use Tableau Prep Builder and/or Tableau Desktop to combine datasets?Have standardized join or blend fields been established by the  to enable users to enrich and prepare datasets?How will you enable self-service data preparation?  Data SecurityData security is of utmost importance in every enterprise. Tableau allows customers to build upon their existing data security implementations.  administrators have the flexibility to implement security within the database with database authentication, within Tableau with permissions, or a hybrid approach of both. Security will be enforced regardless of whether users are accessing the data from published views on the web, on mobile devices, or through Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder. Customers often favor the hybrid approach for its flexibility to handle different kinds of use cases. Start by establishing a data security classification to define the different types of data and levels of sensitivity that exist in your organization.When leveraging database security, it is important to note that the method chosen for authentication to the database is key. This level of authentication is separate from the Tableau  authentication (i.e. when a user logs into Tableau, he or she is not yet logging into the database). This means that Tableau users will also need to have credentials (their own username/password or service account username/password) to connect to the database for the database-level security to apply. To further protect your data, Tableau only needs read-access credentials to the database, which prevents publishers from accidentally changing the underlying data. Alternatively, in some cases, it is useful to give the database user permission to create temporary tables. This can have both performance and security advantages because the temporary data is stored in the database rather than in Tableau. In addition, extract encryption at rest is a data security feature that allows you to encrypt .hyper extracts while they are stored on Tableau Server. Available as of 2019.3, Tableau Server administrators can enforce encryption of all extracts on their site or enable users to encrypt all extracts associated with particular published workbooks or data sources. For more information, see Extract Encryption at Rest. Tableau Online is already fully encrypted at rest.You can limit which users see what data by setting user filters on data sources. This allows you to better control what data users see in a published view based on their Tableau login account. Using this technique, a regional manager can view data for her region but not the data for the other regional managers. With these data security approaches, you can publish a single view or dashboard in a way that provides secure, personalized data and analysis to a wide range of users on Tableau. For more information, see Data Security and Restrict Access at the Data Row Level.Key Considerations for Data SecurityHow do you classify different types of data according to its sensitivity?How does someone request access to data?Will you use a service account or database security to connect to data? What is the appropriate approach to secure data according to sensitivity classification?Does your data security meet legal, compliance, and regulatory requirements? Metadata ManagementMetadata management includes policies and processes that ensure information can be accessed, shared, analyzed and maintained across the organization, as an extension of Data Source Management. Metadata is a business-friendly representation of data in common terms, similar to a semantic layer in traditional  platforms. Curated data sources hide the complexity of your organization’s modern data architecture and make fields immediately understandable regardless of the data store and table from which it was sourced.Tableau employs a simple, elegant, and powerful metadata system that gives users flexibility while allowing for enterprise metadata management. The Tableau Data Model can be embedded in a workbook or centrally managed as a Published Data Source with Data Server. After connecting to data and creating the Tableau Data Model, which will become a Published Data Source on Tableau Server or Tableau Online, look at it from your users’ perspective and see how much easier analytics will be when they have a well-formatted starting point, filtered and sized to the business questions it can answer. For more information on Published Data Sources, visit The Tableau Data Model, Best Practices for Published Data Sources and Enabling Governed Data Access with Tableau Data Server.The diagram below shows where elements exist in the Tableau Data Model:Beginning in 2020.2, the Data Source includes the connection, connection attributes, and the physical and logical layers within a Data Model. Upon connection, Tableau automatically characterizes fields as dimensions or measures. In addition, the Data Model stores calculations, aliases, and formatting. The physical layer includes physical tables defined by joins, unions, and/or custom . Each group of one or more physical tables defines a logical table, which resides in the logical layer along with relationships.Relationships are a new way to model data that is more flexible than using joins. A relationship describes how two tables relate to each other, based on common fields, but it does not combine the tables together as the result of a join does. Relationships provide several advantages over using joins.You don't need to configure join types between tables. You only need to select the fields to define the relationship.Relationships use joins, but they are automatic. Relationships postpone the selection of join types to the time and context of analysis.Tableau uses relationships to automatically generate correct aggregations and appropriate joins during analysis, based on the current context of the fields in use in a worksheet.Multiple tables at different levels of detail are supported in a single data source, so fewer data sources are needed to represent the same data.Unmatched measure values are not dropped (no accidental loss of data).Tableau will generate queries only for the data that is relevant to the current view.At run-time in the Viz model, multiple queries are built dynamically based on the dimensions and measures of the visualization and filters, aggregations, and table calculations are applied. Tableau uses the contextual information of the separate logical table to determine what joins are applied to provide the correct aggregation.  This enables one user to design the Data Source without needing to know, plan, or otherwise account for all the variations of analysis to be performed with the Data Source by other users. Tableau Catalog discovers and indexes all of the content on Tableau, including workbooks, data sources, sheets, and flows.Data stewards or authors with direct access to sources of data should prototype data sources as an embedded data source in a Tableau workbook and then create a Published Data Source in Tableau to share the curated Tableau Data Model, as shown below in the direct access workflow: If authors do not have direct access to sources of data, they will rely on a  or data steward to provide the prototype data source embedded in a Tableau workbook. After reviewing and verifying it contains the needed data, a Site Administrator or Project Leader will create a Published Data Source in Tableau to share the Tableau Data Model, as shown below in the restricted access workflow: The metadata checklist identifies best practices for curating a Published Data Source. By establishing data standards using the checklist, you’ll enable the business with governed self-service data access that is user-friendly and easy to understand. Prior to creating an extract or Published Data Source in Tableau, review and apply the following checklist to the Tableau Data Model: Validate the data modelFilter and size to the analysis at handUse standard, user-friendly naming conventionsAdd field name synonyms and custom suggestions for Ask DataCreate hierarchies (drill paths)Set data typesApply formatting (dates, numbers)Set fiscal year start date, if applicableAdd new calculationsRemove duplicate or test calculationsEnter field descriptions as commentsAggregate to highest levelHide unused fieldsBeginning in 2019.3 in the Data Management Add-on,Tableau Catalog discovers and indexes all of the content on Tableau, including workbooks, data sources, sheets, and flows. Indexing is used to gather information about the metadata, schemas, and lineage of the content. Then from the metadata, Tableau Catalog identifies all of the databases, files, and tables used by the content on your Tableau Server or Tableau Online site. Knowing where your data comes from is key to trusting the data, and knowing who else uses it means you can analyze the impact of changes data in your environment. The lineage feature in Tableau Catalog indexes both internal and external content. For more information, see Use Lineage for Impact Analysis.Using lineage, you can trace down to content owners at the end of the lineage graph. The list of owners includes anyone assigned as the owner of a workbook, data source, or flow, and anyone assigned as the contact for a database or table in the lineage. If a change is going to be made, you can email owners to let them know about its impact. For more information, see Use email to contact owners.Key Considerations for Metadata ManagementWhat is the process for curating data sources?Has the data source been sized to the analysis at hand?What is your organizational standard for naming conventions and field formatting?Does the Tableau Data Model meet all criteria for curation, including user-friendly naming conventions?Has the metadata checklist been defined, published, and integrated into the validation, promotion, and certification processes? Monitoring & ManagementMonitoring is a critical piece of the self-service model as it allows  and administrators to understand how data is being used and be proactive and responsive about usage, performance, data connectivity, and refresh failures. Depending on your company’s database standards,  will use a combination of tools and job schedulers for ingesting and monitoring raw data and server health. Just as business users leverage data to make smarter decisions, administrators are also empowered to make data-driven decisions about their Tableau deployment. With Tableau Server’s default administrative views and custom administrative views, Tableau Server and Site Administrators will use default administrative views for monitoring the status of extract refreshes, data source utilization, and delivery of subscriptions and alerts. Custom administrative views are created from Tableau Server's repository data. In Tableau Online, Site Administrators have access to Monitor Site Activity with default administrative views and can Use Admin Insights to Create Custom Views. For more information, see Tableau Monitoring and the Measurement of Tableau User Engagement and Adoption.Key Considerations for Monitoring & ManagementAre schedules available for the times needed for extract refreshes?How is raw data ingestion monitored from source systems? Did the jobs complete successfully?Are there duplicate sources of data?When are extract refreshes scheduled to run? How long do extracts run on server? Did the refresh succeed or fail? Are subscription schedules available after extract refreshes have occurred?Are data sources being used? By whom? How does this compare with the expected audience size?What is the process to remove stale Published Data Sources? Data Governance SummaryStriking the balance between control and agility is critical. In spite of stringent governance policies, users often go the route of locally saving sensitive data and analytics for quick analysis. In a self-service environment, the role of data governance is to permit access to data and enable users to get the answers they need while ensuring security is enforced. Although every organization has different requirements, the table below describes the ideal state for governing self-service data access: Area Administrators/ ProfessionalsContent ata Source ManagementProvide access to sources of data and comply with organizational data strategy, policies, and procedures.Define, manage, and update data models used for analysis.Data QualityDefine the process to validate data and build trust in its accuracy for decision making.Capture and expose data-cleansing rules applied to published data models.Enrichment & PreparationCreate  processes from multiple sources of data to make data ready for analysis.Capture and expose enrichment and preparation rules applied to published data models.Data SecurityDefine security parameters and access controls to published data models.Comply with enterprise data security policies and external regulations.Metadata ManagementDefine organizational policies and processes for metadata management.Define, update, and expose field-level metadata for users.Monitoring & ManagementMonitor and audit usage to ensure compliance and appropriate use of data assets.Monitor and track usage metrics of centrally-managed data models. Content Governance in TableauAs the use of analytics increases, a growing number of mission-critical business decisions will become data-driven. The net effect is not only an increase in content volume but also in the varying skill levels among its users who will be collaborating and uncovering valuable insights. With more and more people using data daily, it is critical that Tableau content can be secured, governed, and trusted—as well as organized so that people can discover, consume, and create content with confidence. Without content governance, users will find it increasingly difficult to find what they need among irrelevant, stale, or duplicate workbooks and data sources.Content governance involves the processes that keep content relevant and fresh, such as knowing when to decommission content because it’s not getting the expected traffic or finding out why no one is using an important dashboard for decision-making. The responsibility of ensuring compliance with an organization’s content governance policies is a core responsibility of content authors. This section provides  administrators and business users with the core concepts underpinning Tableau’s content governance features and guidance on how these concepts should be applied to manage the content created in a thriving modern analytics platform.Content ManagementDefining a consistent content organization structure allows administrators to manage content and makes content more discoverable by users. Tableau Server and Tableau Online give you the flexibility needed to structure your environment and manage content based your specific governance requirements. Thoughtfully structuring your site will help you deliver true self-service analytics at scale and ensure the responsible use of data to enable your users to discover and share insights.ProjectsTo share and collaborate, users will create and publish content to a project in Tableau Server or Tableau Online. Projects are the default containers used to organize and secure content, holding workbooks, data sources, flows, metrics, and other nested projects within them. This creates a scalable structure for managing access to the content published to Tableau.Organizations are not flat, and neither is the way you govern your content. Projects and nested projects behave much like file system folders to provide hierarchical structures that gather related data and content with the users, groups, and corresponding permissions that mirror your business. Only administrators can create top-level projects, but it is easy to delegate nested projects to Project Owners or Project Leaders for their specific needs. Common content management approaches include organizational (by department/team), functional (by topic), or hybrid (combination of organizational and functional). When planning the content structure, the cross-functional Tableau team should establish consistent naming conventions for project and the groups who will have access to them.For example, in the initial Tableau Server deployment, the Sales, Marketing, and  departments will be onboarded. Following the organizational structure, top-level projects for each will be created for every department. The users in these three departments, also happen to be part of the cross-functional Digital Transformation team. Because digital transformation content spans multiple departments’ users, a separate project named Digital Transformation will also be needed. The users from each of their respective departments will be part of a group who can access them. Users and groups only see projects to which they have access, so do not be concerned with the number of projects that you see as an administrator.Sandbox and Certified ProjectsTo support self-service, sandbox and production projects should be used. Sandbox projects contain ad hoc or uncertified content, and production projects contain validated, certified content. Users should understand the difference in purpose between these two project types. All content authors with access to a sandbox project can freely explore data, author content, and perform ad hoc analysis. The production project’s validated and certified content means that there is a high degree of trust and confidence in it for data-driven decision making.Publishing to the production project is limited to a small group of users who will validate, promote, and certify content for this location. These content management tasks should be delegated to users who are Project Owners and Project Leaders. For more information, see Project Level Administration (Tableau Server | Tableau Online). The roles and the process of content validation, promotion, and certification are described later in this topic.The diagram below shows the Sales department’s project hierarchy with a  Sales Department Data Sources project, which holds department-wide data sources. The nested projects within the Sales department’s project map to sales regions. Groups corresponding to the users within each region have access to the appropriate regional nested projected. The content created by the regions will exist alongside nested projects within them, which will be used to organize and secure it as needed. Beginning with your organizational structure is an appropriate place to begin mapping out your Tableau content structure because departments likely already have security, data, and application access that correspond with their job functions.As a department-team example, Marketing branches out to accommodate shared resources such as department wide production content and data sources, but then lock down specific resources for a group such as Digital which has its own production and sandbox projects. The Marketing project hierarchy is shown below.Permissions should be managed at the project level using locked projects and groups to enforce governed access to content and simplify administration.  While it is possible to manage permissions at an item level with unlocked projects, they will quickly become unwieldly to manage.  Locked projects secure data while providing collaboration across projects when you need it.  For more information, see Use Projects to Manage Content Access (Windows | Linux).With the introduction of locked nested projects in 2020.1, a project can be locked at any level in the project hierarchy regardless of whether the parent is locked with different permissions. Tableau Server and Site Administrators and Tableau Online Site Administrators can manage content and permissions more effectively by delegating content management responsibilities to Project Owners or Project Leaders, who are closer to the work. They will use the locked nested projects with the permissions model that meet their specific group needs at any level in the hierarchy.Check Apply to nested projects to lock nested projects independently.CollectionsCollections, introduced in 2021.2, provide a virtual container for content. Think of Collections as a playlist like you would find in Spotify, giving you the ability to curate the combination of content you want to share with others. This functionality differs from Favoriting, which you can not share with others.Getting started with Collections is easy and available for any Tableau user site role.You can add most content types (e.g. Workbooks, Views, Metrics, Datasources, etc.) to a collection from anywhere across a single site regardless of its project location. It’s a flexible way to onboard new team members, support your workflows, and share related content without moving or duplicating existing items.  Item permissions are still enforced so only the appropriate users will see and have access to content that’s in the collection.There are many ways to use Collections as part of your organization’s content management framework. Continuing the example above, imagine that your organization has multiple projects (Sales and Marketing). You want to give users the ability to easily find related content from across these projects so you create a Collection. Now teams can easily weave a complete picture around a topic from one place.Personal SandboxTo provide a place for all individuals to securely save their work on Tableau Server or Tableau Online, you should create a single personal sandbox and permissions to restrict content owners to only viewing their own items. The personal sandbox can be used for ad hoc or in-progress analysis and hides the content that is not ready for broad release.  When ready, users can move their content to the department sandbox for validation, promotion, and certification process. A single personal sandbox for all users reduces administrative overhead by reducing the number of projects to secure and manage. After creating a top-level project named “Personal Sandbox,” set the permissions on the project for All Users to Publish, None for workbooks, and None for data sources, None for Flows, and None for Metrics.Publisher only permissions at the Project level onlyWith personal sandbox content in a single location, administrators can monitor how often content is viewed, suggest when owners should delete stale content, and check who is making the most use of the personal sandbox. Content owners can always see the content they own, even if it is published in a project where they are denied the ability to view workbooks and data sources. Authorization is explained in more detail in the next section.SitesBoth Tableau Server and Tableau Online support multi-tenancy using sites. In Tableau Server, you can create multiple sites to establish a security boundary that isolates specific users, groups, data, and content on the same Tableau Server deployment. Users of one site do not have access to another site, including visibility of its existence. Because of the strict boundaries, sites work well when there is a deliberate need to prevent users from collaborating, or when content can remain separate during all phases of development.For example, the diagram below shows two Tableau Server sites. In this example, unique users in Site 1 have no access to Site 2 including data and content. A user with access to both Site 1 and Site 2 can only sign into one site at a time. If some content is needed by both sites’ users, it will need to be duplicated within each site, or a new site will need to be created for the shared content for these users, which creates a lot more administrative overhead to monitor, measure, and maintain. In Tableau Online, your instance of Tableau is a single site.Sites create hard boundaries (see diagram above)Sites in Tableau Server may initially appear to be a useful construct for segmenting data sources, workbooks, and users, but the security boundary prohibits collaboration and content promotion that most organizations need for true self-service at scale. For this reason, carefully consider the implications of using sites instead of projects in a single site with delegated content management responsibilities. To illustrate the hard boundaries across sites, when you stand up a new site, relevant data sources need to be re-created in the new instance.New sites should only be created when you need to manage a unique set of users and their content separately from all other Tableau users and content because content is purposefully not shareable across the boundaries. For more information and examples of when it makes sense to use sites, see Sites Overview (Windows | Linux).Key Considerations for Content ManagementWill workbooks and data sources be shared across the company?Will sites be used to isolate sensitive content or departments?Will projects use an organizational (departments/teams), functional (topics), or hybrid approach?Have sandbox and production projects been setup to support ad-hoc and validated content?Are content naming conventions used? Are authors publishing multiple copies of the same workbook with different filters selected?Does content have a description, tags, and comply with visual styles?Do you have a load time expectation and an exception procedure in place?After employees leave the company, what is the process to reassign content ownership? AuthorizationWhen a user attempts to login to Tableau, authentication verifies a user’s identity. Everyone who needs access to Tableau Server must be represented as a user in Tableau Server’s identity store (Windows | Linux). Tableau Online Authentication supports Tableau, Google, and  to verify a user's identity. Authorization refers to how and what users can access on Tableau Server and Tableau Online after the user has been authenticated. Authorization includes:What users are allowed to do with content hosted in Tableau Server and Tableau Online, including site, projects, workbooks, views, data sources, and flows.What tasks users are allowed to perform to administer Tableau Server and Tableau Online, such as configuring server and site settings, running command line tools, creating sites, and other tasks.Authorization for these actions is managed by Tableau Server and Tableau Online and determined by a combination of the user's license type, site role, and permissions associated with specific entities such as workbooks and data sources. Tableau’s role-based licenses have implicit governance built in because of the capabilities that are included with them. For more information on specific capabilities by each license, see Tableau for Teams and Organizations.When you add users to a site on Tableau Server or Tableau Online, independent of their license type, you must apply a site role to them. The site role signifies the maximum level of access a user can have on the site. Users with a Tableau Creator license have access to Tableau Server or Tableau Online, Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep Builder, and Tableau Mobile. The following site roles use a Tableau Creator license:Site RoleDescriptionServer AdministratorAvailable on Tableau Server only; not applicable to Tableau Online.Configure settings for the Tableau Server, all sites on the server, users and groups, and all content assets, such as projects, data sources (including connection information), workbooks, and flows.Connect to Tableau Published Data Sources or external data from the browser, Tableau Desktop, or Tableau Prep Builder; create and publish new data sources and flows; author and publish workbooks.Site Administrator CreatorUnrestricted access to content as described above, but at the site level. Connect to Tableau or external data in the browser, Tableau Desktop, or Tableau Prep Builder; create new data sources; build and publish content.On Tableau Server, server administrators can determine whether to allow site administrators to manage users and assign site roles and site membership. By default, on Tableau Server, and always on Tableau Online, site administrators are allowed these capabilities.This is the highest level of access for Tableau Online. Site Administrators have access to Site configuration settings.CreatorConnect to data to author new data sources and dashboards, which are published and shared on Tableau Server and Tableau Online. Data stewards ( or data analyst) publish data sources. Creators incorporate process definitions, policies, guidelines, and business knowledge for enterprise metadata management in compliance with organizational and/or regulatory obligations.  Users with a Tableau Explorer license have access to Tableau Server or Tableau Online and Tableau Mobile. The following site roles use a Tableau Explorer license:Site RoleDescriptionSite Administrator ExplorerSame access to site and user configuration as Site Administrator Creator but cannot connect to external data from the web editing environment.Connect to Tableau Published Data Sources to create new workbooks and edit and save existing workbooks.Explorer (Can Publish)Publish new content from browser, browse and interact with published views, use all interaction features. In the web editing environment, can edit and save existing workbooks, and save new standalone data sources from data connections embedded in workbooks, but cannot connect to external data and create new data sources.ExplorerBrowse and interact with published views. Can subscribe to content, create data driven alerts, connect to Tableau Published Data Sources and open workbooks in the web authoring environment for ad-hoc queries, but they cannot save their work.  Users with a Tableau Viewer license have access to Tableau Server or Tableau Online and Tableau Mobile. Site RoleDescriptionViewerView and interact with filters and content. Viewers can also receive alerts triggered by business events. Users who have been added to Tableau Server or Tableau Online but without a license are Unlicensed.Site RoleDescriptionUnlicensedUnlicensed users cannot sign in to Tableau Server or Tableau Online.  Site roles along with content permissions determines who can publish, interact with, or only view published content, as well as who can manage the site’s users and administer the site itself. The project team should work together to define the content permissions model. Tableau Server and/or Site Administrators will assign permission rules to groups and lock them to the project. Locked projects enforce permission rules on all content within the container, including nested projects. For more information, see Set Project Default Permissions and Lock the Project.Tableau has default permission rules for projects, workbooks, and data sources, or you can define custom permission rules for these content types. Permission Rules TemplateDescriptionProject LeaderCombined with the appropriate site role, allows the user or group full access to the project, its child projects, and content published into that project hierarchy. EditorAllows the user or group to connect to, edit, download, delete, and set permissions for data sources or workbooks in the project. They can also publish data sources, and provided they are the owner of a data source they publish, can update connection information and extract refresh schedules. This permission is relevant for views when the view they access connects to a data source. PublisherAllows the user or group to publish workbooks and data sources to the project. ConnectorAllows the user or group to connect to data sources in the project. ViewerAllows the user or group to view the workbooks and views in the project. NoneSets all capabilities for the permission rule to Unspecified. DeniedSets all capabilities for the permission rule to Denied. Custom permissions allow more granularity in permissions—from accessing or downloading a data source to how a user interacts with published content. Tableau’s intuitive interface makes it easy to associate users to functional groups, assign permissions to the groups, and see who has access to which content. For more information, see Set Permissions on Individual Content Resources. If the Data Management Add-on is present, permissions for external assets have additional considerations. For more information, see Manage Permissions for External Assets.You should create groups locally on the server or import from Active Directory/ and synchronize (Windows | Linux) on a set schedule. Synchronization schedules are set by the Tableau Server Administrator or Tableau Online Site Administrators. To simplify maintenance, assign permissions to groups at the project level as shown below. For Tableau Online, you can Automate User Provisioning and Group Synchronization in Tableau Online through an External Identity Provider via  and add or remove users or add or remove members from groups  using the   programmatically.For more information, see Set-up Permissions Quick Start, Configure Projects, Groups, and Permissions for Managed Self-Service, and Permissions Reference.  Key Considerations for AuthorizationWhat is the minimum site role for Active Directory/ or  group synchronization?Have you set all permissions for the All Users group in the Default project to None?Are any explicit restrictions (Deny permissions) needed on the All Users group to propagate to every user account?Have you created groups that correspond to a set of authoring and viewing capabilities for each project?Have you reviewed effective permissions on select users to test your permissions model?Have you locked permissions at the parent project to maintain security throughout the project hierarchy?Have service account usernames/passwords been established for Published Data Sources? Content ValidationContent validation is the first step in a series of events that will culminate in content certification. Similar to the data quality area in data governance, content validation encompasses the processes to validate that content is accurate, complete, reliable, relevant, and recent. The first role to validate content should be its author. Authors should solicit feedback from the target audience as well. This can be done in an informal feedback group or by sharing a link to the workbook. Data stewards should also play a role to ensure correctness and review an embedded data source as a potential candidate for publishing and certifying. If the data source is embedded in the workbook, the data steward should consider whether it is a potential candidate for publishing and certifying. Beyond data and calculation correctness, content validation should also include a review of the branding, layout, formatting, performance, filters, dashboard actions, and edge case behaviors by the Site Administrator or Project Leader site roles.Key Considerations for Content ValidationWho is involved in the validation process?Is the workbook accurate, complete, reliable, relevant, and recent?Does the new content replace existing content?Are the underlying data and calculations correct?Does the workbook reflect corporate branding?Does the workbook have a logical layout?Are all axes and numbers formatted correctly?Do dashboards load within the acceptable performance time?Do filters and dashboard actions behave on the targeted views?Does the dashboard remain useful in edge case behaviors (filtered to all, none, one value, etc.)? Content PromotionAfter content validation is complete, the process of content promotion is used to publish the workbook to a trusted project location or add the certification badge designation for Published Data Sources. An example of a workbook workflow is shown below.Workbook WorkflowContent authors will connect to data, create new dashboards, and publish to the sandbox project. Site Administrators or Project Leaders will validate and approve the content. The approved content will be published to the production project. The Content Migration Tool, licensed as part of the Tableau Server Management Add-on, provides an easy way to promote or migrate content between Tableau Server projects. You can do this between projects on separate Tableau Server installations (for instance, between a development instance of Tableau Server and a product installation with appropriate licensing for each environment), or between projects on a single Tableau Server installation. The Content Migration Tool User Interface walks you through the steps necessary to build a ""migration plan"" that you can use a single time, or as a template for multiple migrations. To learn more about use cases, visit Content Migration Tool Use Cases.If  requirements mandate three separately licensed environments (Dev, , and Production), try not to replicate a traditional waterfall development cycle with a modern analytics platform. Users may favor the  environment to circumvent stringent policies or delays to get content into production, so work towards a good balance by automating content migration to the production server with custom workflow scripts using Tableau’s  s.Key Considerations for Content PromotionWho is involved in the promotion process?Do content-promoting roles have a checklist of criteria to evaluate?Have you clearly delineated between certified content and ad-hoc content by projects?Is the process agile to support iterations and innovation?Do you have workflows to address both direct and restricted sources of data and workbooks?  Content CertificationAfter content has been validated and promoted, it achieves a trusted, certified status when a Site Administrator, Project Leader, or a Publisher (content author or data steward) with permission to the production project promotes the workbook or data source to the designated location. Certification makes content discoverable by content consumers and improves data stewards’ abilities to govern enterprise-wide data more effectively in Tableau by reducing the proliferation of duplicate workbooks and data sources.Use the baseline requirements that were established in key considerations for content validation as the criteria for becoming certified. Content authors should have a clear understanding of how the certification process works from start to finish, and content consumers should know where certified content is published in the production project, as defined by your content management standards.Data source certification enables data stewards to promote specific data sources in your Tableau deployment as trusted and ready for use. Certified Data Sources get preferential treatment in Tableau Server and Tableau Online search results and in our smart data source recommendations algorithm so that they are discoverable and easily reusable.Certified Data SourceKey Considerations for Content CertificationWho is responsible for designating certified content?Have all criteria for achieving certification status been met?Are all fields completed: about, certification notes, tags? Content UtilizationContent utilization is a measurement of the effective use of the data for business decisions, but the complete picture cannot be told through Traffic to Views alone. Measurement of content utilization helps your deployment to operate at scale and evolve by understanding user behaviors—who creates and consumes content, and the quality and relevance of the dashboards and data sources. If content isn’t being consumed, you will be able to identify it, and take the appropriate next steps.Tableau Server Administrators and Tableau Online Site Administrators should monitor broad usage patterns with default administrative views. For more specific requirements, it is possible to create custom administrative views. For Tableau Server, this can be done with Tableau Server repository data.  In Tableau Online, Site Administrators have access to Monitor Site Activity with default administrative views and can Use Admin Insights to Create Custom Views.   Site Administrators should measure and audit usage of published content—both certified and ad-hoc—within their site. For example, if ad-hoc content utilization is significantly higher than certified content utilization, perhaps the promotion process is too restrictive or takes too long for business needs. Site Administrators should review content utilization in the context of the expected audience sizes that were documented on theTableau Use Cases and Data Sources tab of the Tableau Blueprint Planner. Individual content authors should also review utilization for their content in the sparkline tooltip by hovering over the workbook’s thumbnail or selecting Who Has Seen This View from the menu. For more information, see the Measurement of Tableau User Engagement and Adoption.Key Considerations for Content UtilizationHow much traffic goes to each view? What is the definition of stale content? How often is stale content purged?How much indirect utilization (alerts & subscriptions) occurs?Are subscriptions delivered on time?Does the actual audience size match with expectations?Does content follow a weekly, monthly, quarterly trend?What is the frequency of login or days since last login by user cohort?What is the distribution of workbook and data source size? Content Governance SummaryThe table below defines the ideal state for promoting and governing content in a thriving modern analytics deployment: Area Administrators/ ProfessionalsContent ontent ManagementCreate and maintain an environment for storing and organizing published content. Ensure content is relevant in their site or project.Security & PermissionsSecure analytic content and grant users the appropriate levels of access based on content type, sensitivity, business need, etc. Comply with organizational security and permissions policies.Content ValidationDefine process for validating content is correct.Access platform capabilities to assist with validation and accuracy verification of user- generated analytic content. Content PromotionDefine process for promoting content.Promote validated analytic content to centralized-trusted environment as determined by governance process. Content CertificationDefine process for certifying content.Certify content as trusted and delineate from untrusted content in the same environment. Content UtilizationMeasure broad usage patterns across organizational business units.Measure and audit usage of published content and track usage of untrusted content.   Back to topThanks for your feedback!LegalPrivacy© 2003-2022 Tableau Software . All rights reserved "," To define your organization’s Tableau Governance Models, you should work through the areas of data and content governance that are outlined in the diagram below using the Tableau Blueprint Planner. Data Governance in TableauThe purpose of data governance in the Modern Analytics Workflow is to ensure that the right data is available to the right people in the organization, at the time they need it. It creates accountability and enables, rather than restricts, access to secure and trusted content and for users of all skill levels.Data Source ManagementData source management includes processes related to selection and distribution of data within your organization. In a self-service environment, content authors and data stewards have the ability to connect to various data sources, build and publish data sources, workbooks, and other content. Without these processes, there will be a proliferation of duplicate data sources, which will cause confusion among users, increase likelihood of errors, and consume system resources. With support for a new multi-table logical layer and relationships in Tableau 2020.2, users aren’t limited to using data from a single, flat, denormalized table in a Tableau Data Source. With multi-table support, Tableau data sources can now directly represent common enterprise data models such as star and snowflake schemas, as well as more complex, multi-fact models. For more information, see Metadata Management later in this section and The Tableau Data Model.When publishing a workbook to Tableau Server or Tableau Online, the author will have a choice to publish the data source or leave it embedded in the workbook. With Tableau Data Server, which is a built-in component of the Tableau platform, you can share and reuse data models, secure how your users access data, and manage and consolidate extracts with Published Data Sources. Further, Published Data Sources allow Tableau Creator- and Explorer-licensed users to have access to secure, trusted data in Tableau for web authoring and Ask Data. With increased data discovery capabilities, Tableau Catalog indexes all content, including workbooks, data sources, and flows to allow authors to search for fields, columns, databases, and tables in workbooks and published data sources. For more information, see Data Management Add-on.When Tableau Catalog is enabled, content authors can Search for Data by selecting from Data Sources, Databases and Files, or Tables to see if it exists in Tableau Server and Tableau Online and minimize duplication of data sources.In addition, the Data Details tab on a view published to Tableau Server and Tableau Online will provide consumers with relevant information about the data used in it. Details include information about the workbook (name, author, date modified), the data sources used in the view, and a list of the fields in use.For data stewards who create new Published Data Sources, the workflow below shows the two major decision points that impact data source management—live or extract and embedded or shared data model. This is not to imply that a formal modeling process must always occur before analysis begins.To discover and prioritize key sources of data, use the Tableau Data and Analytics Survey and Tableau Use Cases and Data Sources tabs in the Tableau Blueprint Planner. With the Tableau Data Management Add-on and Tableau Catalog, you should communicate data quality issues to your users to increase visibility and trust in the data. For more information, see Add Data Quality Warning in the Tableau   Help.Key Considerations for Data QualityWhat processes exist for ensuring accuracy, completeness, reliability, and relevance?Have you developed a checklist to operationalize the process?Who needs to review data prior to it becoming shared and trusted?Is your process adaptable to business users and are they able to partner with data owners to report issues? With command line interfaces and s, Tableau can be integrated with your existing processes.For self-service data preparation, Tableau Prep Builder and Tableau Prep Conductor,  should be used to combine multiple sources of data and automate on a schedule. Tableau Prep has multiple output types to Tableau Server or Tableau Online, including , Hyper, and , or Published Data Sources. Tableau Prep Builder is part of the Tableau Creator license, while Tableau Prep Conductor is part of the Tableau Data Management Add-On. Tableau Data Management helps you better manage the data within your analytics environment from data preparation to cataloging, search, and governance, ensuring that trusted and up-to-date data is always used to drive decisions.With visual, smart, direct feedback at every step, Tableau Prep Builder will help users to prototype and prepare disparate sources of data for analysis. Once the steps are defined and verified, the flow should be published to Tableau Server and Tableau Online where Prep Conductor will execute the flow and output a Published Data Source on the specified schedule. administrators have the flexibility to implement security within the database with database authentication, within Tableau with permissions, or a hybrid approach of both. Security will be enforced regardless of whether users are accessing the data from published views on the web, on mobile devices, or through Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder. when a user logs into Tableau, he or she is not yet logging into the database). To further protect your data, Tableau only needs read-access credentials to the database, which prevents publishers from accidentally changing the underlying data. In addition, extract encryption at rest is a data security feature that allows you to encrypt .hyper extracts while they are stored on Tableau Server. Available as of 2019.3, Tableau Server administrators can enforce encryption of all extracts on their site or enable users to encrypt all extracts associated with particular published workbooks or data sources. With these data security approaches, you can publish a single view or dashboard in a way that provides secure, personalized data and analysis to a wide range of users on Tableau. For more information, see Data Security and Restrict Access at the Data Row Level.Key Considerations for Data SecurityHow do you classify different types of data according to its sensitivity?How does someone request access to data?Will you use a service account or database security to connect to data? Tableau employs a simple, elegant, and powerful metadata system that gives users flexibility while allowing for enterprise metadata management. After connecting to data and creating the Tableau Data Model, which will become a Published Data Source on Tableau Server or Tableau Online, look at it from your users’ perspective and see how much easier analytics will be when they have a well-formatted starting point, filtered and sized to the business questions it can answer. For more information on Published Data Sources, visit The Tableau Data Model, Best Practices for Published Data Sources and Enabling Governed Data Access with Tableau Data Server.The diagram below shows where elements exist in the Tableau Data Model:Beginning in 2020.2, the Data Source includes the connection, connection attributes, and the physical and logical layers within a Data Model. Tableau Catalog discovers and indexes all of the content on Tableau, including workbooks, data sources, sheets, and flows.Data stewards or authors with direct access to sources of data should prototype data sources as an embedded data source in a Tableau workbook and then create a Published Data Source in Tableau to share the curated Tableau Data Model, as shown below in the direct access workflow: If authors do not have direct access to sources of data, they will rely on a  or data steward to provide the prototype data source embedded in a Tableau workbook. After reviewing and verifying it contains the needed data, a Site Administrator or Project Leader will create a Published Data Source in Tableau to share the Tableau Data Model, as shown below in the restricted access workflow: The metadata checklist identifies best practices for curating a Published Data Source. Prior to creating an extract or Published Data Source in Tableau, review and apply the following checklist to the Tableau Data Model: Validate the data modelFilter and size to the analysis at handUse standard, user-friendly naming conventionsAdd field name synonyms and custom suggestions for Ask DataCreate hierarchies (drill paths)Set data typesApply formatting (dates, numbers)Set fiscal year start date, if applicableAdd new calculationsRemove duplicate or test calculationsEnter field descriptions as commentsAggregate to highest levelHide unused fieldsBeginning in 2019.3 in the Data Management Add-on,Tableau Catalog discovers and indexes all of the content on Tableau, including workbooks, data sources, sheets, and flows. Then from the metadata, Tableau Catalog identifies all of the databases, files, and tables used by the content on your Tableau Server or Tableau Online site. For more information, see Use email to contact owners.Key Considerations for Metadata ManagementWhat is the process for curating data sources?Has the data source been sized to the analysis at hand?What is your organizational standard for naming conventions and field formatting?Does the Tableau Data Model meet all criteria for curation, including user-friendly naming conventions?Has the metadata checklist been defined, published, and integrated into the validation, promotion, and certification processes? Just as business users leverage data to make smarter decisions, administrators are also empowered to make data-driven decisions about their Tableau deployment. With Tableau Server’s default administrative views and custom administrative views, Tableau Server and Site Administrators will use default administrative views for monitoring the status of extract refreshes, data source utilization, and delivery of subscriptions and alerts. In Tableau Online, Site Administrators have access to Monitor Site Activity with default administrative views and can Use Admin Insights to Create Custom Views. For more information, see Tableau Monitoring and the Measurement of Tableau User Engagement and Adoption.Key Considerations for Monitoring & ManagementAre schedules available for the times needed for extract refreshes?How is raw data ingestion monitored from source systems? Although every organization has different requirements, the table below describes the ideal state for governing self-service data access: Area Administrators/ ProfessionalsContent ata Source ManagementProvide access to sources of data and comply with organizational data strategy, policies, and procedures.Define, manage, and update data models used for analysis.Data QualityDefine the process to validate data and build trust in its accuracy for decision making.Capture and expose data-cleansing rules applied to published data models.Enrichment & PreparationCreate  processes from multiple sources of data to make data ready for analysis.Capture and expose enrichment and preparation rules applied to published data models.Data SecurityDefine security parameters and access controls to published data models.Comply with enterprise data security policies and external regulations.Metadata ManagementDefine organizational policies and processes for metadata management.Define, update, and expose field-level metadata for users.Monitoring & ManagementMonitor and audit usage to ensure compliance and appropriate use of data assets.Monitor and track usage metrics of centrally-managed data models. Content Governance in TableauAs the use of analytics increases, a growing number of mission-critical business decisions will become data-driven. With more and more people using data daily, it is critical that Tableau content can be secured, governed, and trusted—as well as organized so that people can discover, consume, and create content with confidence. Without content governance, users will find it increasingly difficult to find what they need among irrelevant, stale, or duplicate workbooks and data sources.Content governance involves the processes that keep content relevant and fresh, such as knowing when to decommission content because it’s not getting the expected traffic or finding out why no one is using an important dashboard for decision-making. Thoughtfully structuring your site will help you deliver true self-service analytics at scale and ensure the responsible use of data to enable your users to discover and share insights.ProjectsTo share and collaborate, users will create and publish content to a project in Tableau Server or Tableau Online. Projects are the default containers used to organize and secure content, holding workbooks, data sources, flows, metrics, and other nested projects within them. Projects and nested projects behave much like file system folders to provide hierarchical structures that gather related data and content with the users, groups, and corresponding permissions that mirror your business. When planning the content structure, the cross-functional Tableau team should establish consistent naming conventions for project and the groups who will have access to them.For example, in the initial Tableau Server deployment, the Sales, Marketing, and  departments will be onboarded. The production project’s validated and certified content means that there is a high degree of trust and confidence in it for data-driven decision making.Publishing to the production project is limited to a small group of users who will validate, promote, and certify content for this location. The roles and the process of content validation, promotion, and certification are described later in this topic.The diagram below shows the Sales department’s project hierarchy with a  Sales Department Data Sources project, which holds department-wide data sources. Beginning with your organizational structure is an appropriate place to begin mapping out your Tableau content structure because departments likely already have security, data, and application access that correspond with their job functions.As a department-team example, Marketing branches out to accommodate shared resources such as department wide production content and data sources, but then lock down specific resources for a group such as Digital which has its own production and sandbox projects. Tableau Server and Site Administrators and Tableau Online Site Administrators can manage content and permissions more effectively by delegating content management responsibilities to Project Owners or Project Leaders, who are closer to the work. Now teams can easily weave a complete picture around a topic from one place.Personal SandboxTo provide a place for all individuals to securely save their work on Tableau Server or Tableau Online, you should create a single personal sandbox and permissions to restrict content owners to only viewing their own items. After creating a top-level project named “Personal Sandbox,” set the permissions on the project for All Users to Publish, None for workbooks, and None for data sources, None for Flows, and None for Metrics.Publisher only permissions at the Project level onlyWith personal sandbox content in a single location, administrators can monitor how often content is viewed, suggest when owners should delete stale content, and check who is making the most use of the personal sandbox. Content owners can always see the content they own, even if it is published in a project where they are denied the ability to view workbooks and data sources. In Tableau Server, you can create multiple sites to establish a security boundary that isolates specific users, groups, data, and content on the same Tableau Server deployment. Because of the strict boundaries, sites work well when there is a deliberate need to prevent users from collaborating, or when content can remain separate during all phases of development.For example, the diagram below shows two Tableau Server sites. In this example, unique users in Site 1 have no access to Site 2 including data and content. In Tableau Online, your instance of Tableau is a single site.Sites create hard boundaries (see diagram above)Sites in Tableau Server may initially appear to be a useful construct for segmenting data sources, workbooks, and users, but the security boundary prohibits collaboration and content promotion that most organizations need for true self-service at scale.

Measurement of content utilization helps your deployment to operate at scale and evolve by understanding user behaviors—who creates and consumes content, and the quality and relevance of the dashboards and data sources. If content isn’t being consumed, you will be able to identify it, and take the appropriate next steps.Tableau Server Administrators and Tableau Online Site Administrators should monitor broad usage patterns with default administrative views. In Tableau Online, Site Administrators have access to Monitor Site Activity with default administrative views and can Use Admin Insights to Create Custom Views. For more information, see the Measurement of Tableau User Engagement and Adoption.Key Considerations for Content UtilizationHow much traffic goes to each view? Ensure content is relevant in their site or project.Security & PermissionsSecure analytic content and grant users the appropriate levels of access based on content type, sensitivity, business need, etc."

Data is increasing in volume, formats, and importance leading to more complex environments. With the rapid pace that data changes, it can be hard to keep track of that data and how it's being used in such complex environments. At the same time, more users need to access more of that data in more places, and it’s difficult for users to find the right data. Ultimately, this causes a lack of trust in the data because people question whether they’re using the right source or if it’s up to date.
Tableau Catalog integrates features like lineage, impact analysis, data dictionary, data quality warnings, and search into your Tableau applications, helping solve these problems differently from a stand-alone catalog. It focuses on both IT and the end user so that everyone using Tableau Server or Tableau Online has more visibility and trust into the data, while also enabling more discoverability. Tableau Catalog builds a catalog out of the Tableau content being used by your organization, enabling comprehensive functionality like the following:

Impact analysis and lineage. You can see the workbooks and other Tableau content that depend on particular columns or fields from tables or data sources you manage. When you need to make changes to your data, you can notify the impacted Tableau authors using email. As a workbook author, you can use lineage to trace the fields that your workbook depends on.As a user, when you use a Tableau visualization, you can see where the data came from that was used to create the view.
Curation and trust. As a data steward, you can add helpful metadata, like descriptions and certification, so that users find the right data. You can set data quality warnings, view data details on the Data Details pane, certify assets, and remove assets from the catalog.
Data discovery. You can use Tableau Catalog to search  for databases, tables, and data sources to analyze in Tableau and connect to them from the search results.

Starting in 2019.3, Tableau Catalog is available in the Data Management Add-on to Tableau Server and Tableau Online. When the product key is active and enabled, the catalog features described above are integrated into the product you're using, so you can work with the data where you find it.
How Tableau Catalog works
Tableau Catalog discovers and indexes all the content on your site—workbooks, data sources, sheets, and flows—to gather metadata about the content. From the metadata, databases and tables (also referred to as external assets) are identified. Knowing the relationships between the content and the external assets enables Tableau to display the lineage of the content and assets. Tableau Catalog also enables users to connect to external assets using Tableau Server or Tableau Online.
For information about how you can use Tableau Catalog to support data governance in your organization, see Governance in Tableau in the Tableau Blueprint Help.
Key Tableau Catalog terms

Metadata. Information about the data.
Tableau content. Content created in Tableau such as workbooks, data sources, and flows.
External assets. The metadata about the databases and tables used by the Tableau content published to Tableau Server or Tableau Online.

License Tableau Catalog
Tableau Catalog is licensed through the Data Management Add-on. For information about how Data Management Add-on licensing works, see License the Data Management Add-on. 
Enable Tableau Catalog
After Tableau Server or Tableau Online is licensed with the Data Management Add-on, you can enable Tableau Catalog by doing one of the following tasks:

For Tableau Online, no action necessary. Tableau Catalog is on by default, configured to use derived permissions, and ready to use. For more information about derived permissions, see the Permissions on assets and their metadata topic. 

For Tableau Server, the Server admin must first enable the Tableau Metadata API using the tsm maintenance metadata-services command. For more information, see Enable Tableau Catalog.
After the Metadata API is enabled, Tableau Catalog is on by default, configured to use derived permissions, and ready to use. For more information about derived permissions, see the Permissions on assets and their metadata topic.


Features and functionality
To learn more about the features you can use with Tableau Catalog, see the following Help articles:
Data discovery

In the Connect pane on Tableau Desktop, under Search for Data select Tableau Server to connect to data using Tableau Server or Tableau Online. When Tableau Catalog is enabled, in addition to searching for published data sources to connect to, you can now search for and connect to the specific databases and tables used by published data sources and workbooks on your Tableau Server or your Tableau Online site. 
Search is expanded to include results based on fields, columns, databases, and tables when Tableau Catalog is enabled.
If you author in the web, you can also connect to databases and tables, as well as published data sources, from Tableau Server and Tableau Online.

Curation and trust

Certify your data assets to help users find trusted and recommended data.
Set data quality warnings to alert users to data quality issues, such as stale or deprecated data.
Better understand published visualizations  by using the Data Details tab to see information about the data used.
Add descriptions to databases, tables, and columns to help users find the data they're looking for.

Lineage and impact analysis

Use lineage to trace the source of your data and to analyze the impact of changes to your data and identify which users might be impacted.
Email owners of a workbook, data source, or flow or contacts for a database or table about data-related updates.

Developer resources
You can use the Tableau Metadata API to programmatically query metadata from the content published to Tableau Server or Tableau Online. The Metadata API is fast and flexible and is best when you are looking to find out specific information about the relationship between metadata and its structures. 
In addition to the Metadata API, you can use metadata methods in the Tableau Server REST API to programmatically update certain metadata. For more information about metadata methods , see Metadata Methods in the Tableau Server REST API.

Recognize types of dashboards and when to use them.
Explain how to filter dashboards to analyze your data.
Describe the different ways to export dashboards.


What Are Dashboards?

Dashboards provide you with a ready-to-use visualization of your email and journey data. Let’s see how Isabelle, Northern Trail Outfitters’s (NTO) manager of digital marketing, uses dashboards to monitor how her birthday campaign is performing. More importantly, she’s interested in the campaign deliveries and engagement. Datorama Reports offers predefined dashboards allowing Isabelle to easily visualize her data to gain valuable insights and quickly identify trends. 


Email Overview: Provides you with a high–level overview of your email campaigns, such as the number of emails sent, open rate, and so on.

Email Deliveries: Provides a detailed visualization of your email delivery data, such as delivery KPIs–including sends, deliveries, bounces, delivery timelines, and in-depth breakdowns by domain, day of week, and audience.

Email Engagement: Provides a detailed visualization of your email engagement data, such as engagement KPIs, including opens, clicks, unsubscribes, engagement timelines, and in-depth breakdowns by domain, day of week, and audience.

Email Performance: Provides a detailed visualization of your email performance data, such as email sends data, including open rate, click rate, unsubscribe rate, performance funnel, and in-depth breakdowns by domain, day of week, and audience.

Journey Performance by Email: Provides an in-depth view into your journey and activities data, including the journey performance and a detailed breakdown by domain, day of week, and audience.

Push Deliveries: Provides a detailed visualization of your push delivery data, including push notification delivery data and timelines. Get breakdowns by day of the week, mobile OS, and mobile app.

Push Engagement: Provides details about your push notification engagement key performance indicators (KPIs), including deliveries, opens, and open rate. View breakdowns by day of the week, mobile OS, and mobile apps.

Journey Performance by Push: Provides details about your journey and push notification performance data. View breakdowns by day of the week, mobile OS, and mobile app.

Let’s follow along as Isabelle uses these dashboards to analyze and improve her birthday campaign.

Put Dashboards to Work

Isabelle plans to use two of the predefined dashboards to focus on her campaign’s performance: Email Deliveries and Email Engagement. She starts with the Email Deliveries dashboard. 

Isabelle has already filtered her Email Deliveries dashboard (1) to focus on the relevant information by filtering by her business unit (Northern Trail Outfitters) and campaign (Birthday). She sees her delivery KPIs, including Sends, Deliveries, and Bounce Rate and notices that her sends and deliveries have increased while her bounce rate has decreased (2). In the Delivery Timeline (3) she uses the interactive filters to focus her data on a specific measurement, like bounce rate, so she can see trends over time (4). 
Isabelle can also take a look at the Email Engagement dashboard to see how her users engaged with an email. 

Once she clicks the dashboard, it is automatically filtered for her since filters are saved automatically—even when toggling between different dashboards (1). Here she can focus on the main Engagement KPIs (2), such as Open Rate and Click Rate. She can also scroll down and see which day of the week had the highest open rate, which helps her plan future sends. 

Share Your Dashboards

If you want to share a dashboard with others or create a report to be scheduled and delivered, you can use the share option. This allows you to: 


Share via Slack: This option shares a dashboard page or widget directly to Slack.

Share via Email: This option shares a dashboard page or widget via email.

Download: This option downloads a local file of a dashboard page or widget, either as a PNG, Excel, PDF or PPT file format.

Create Scheduled Report: This option creates a report with the dashboard that can be set to run as part of a workflow, in real-time, or according to a defined schedule. We cover scheduled reports in more detail in the final unit.

Now onto the next unit where you learn how to use pivot tables in Datorama Reports.

Explore Your Data with Pivot Tables



Learning Objectives

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

Describe pivot tables and when to use them.
Create a pivot table in Datorama Reports.
Explain the different ways you can export a pivot table.


Make the Most of Your Data with Pivot Tables

Pivot tables allow you to explore your data from multiple perspectives. You can use pivot tables to filter, sort, and group large volumes of data according to any metric or dimension. Plus, with pivot tables, you can create custom reports that organize, summarize, and slice your data without the need to write and run queries. 
This means you can easily create a pivot table that shows a breakdown of your email send data, so you can see how many emails were sent, delivered, and bounced for a specific time period. You can also use a pivot table to see which send day had the best performance—meaning which day had the highest open rate, click-to-open rate, and email opens. The options are endless. 
In this module, we assume you are a Marketing Cloud user with the proper permissions to access Datorama Reports to create pivot tables and scheduled reports. If you’re not, that’s OK. Read along to learn how your admin would take the steps in a production org. Don’t try to follow these steps in your Trailhead Playground. Marketing Cloud isn’t available in the Trailhead Playground.
Let’s see how Paulo, a marketing specialist from NTO, uses a pivot table to explore which email performed best. 

Create a Pivot Table

Paulo navigates to Pivot Tables in Datorama Reports and clicks Create New Pivot Table. He then sets up the pivot table in just a few steps. 

First, he enters a name for the pivot table.
Next, he sets the dates for which the data is pulled. In this case he wants to see last month’s data.
In the Settings dialog, he begins defining the pivot table’s dimensions, measurements, and more.
He selects Email Name and Email Subject for the dimensions (by default, dimensions are set as Rows).
He selects Email Open Rate and Email Click to Open Rate for the measurements (by default, measurements are set as Values).
He adds an optional filter so that only NTO emails are included.
Finally, he clicks Apply when he’s done.


After clicking Apply, Paulo can see his pivot table with results that show the best-performing emails based on high open and click-to-open rates.


Export a Pivot Table

Once you’ve created and customized your pivot table you can now export it. There are a few different ways you can export. 


Export: This option exports the pivot table to an Excel file either as a pivot table or flat table.

Schedule export: This option exports directly to a report format (either pivot table or Excel), which can be set to run as part of a workflow, in real time, or according to a defined schedule. We cover reports in more detail in the last unit.

Now that you know more about pivot tables, move onto the next unit so you can learn more about reports.

Create Scheduled Reports



Learning Objectives

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

Explain what scheduled reports are and when to use them.
Describe the different types of reports.
Create a scheduled report.


Review Your Data with Reports

You can create a report when you want to retrieve, view, and share a detailed analysis of your data. You can either create a report from scratch or export an entity (like a pivot table or dashboard page) to a scheduled report, as you learned in earlier units. You have the ability to create a few different types of reports.


Flat Table (Excel/CSV): Creates a flat file with the data. For example, display the total number of sends per send date. This can also be achieved by using Schedule Export to a Flat Table on a predefined pivot table.

Pivot Table (XLS): Creates an Excel in the same structure as your pivot table view. This can also be achieved by using Schedule Export to a Pivot Table on a predefined pivot table.

Dashboard (PDF): Exports a dashboard into a PDF. This can also be achieved by using the Schedule Export option on a predefined dashboard.

Once you’ve created a report, you can define scheduling and delivery information. Datorama supports nine delivery methods, including:

AzureBlob
Email
FTP
FTPS
Google Drive
HDFS
SFTP
AWS - S3
Google Cloud Storage

Ralph, the VP of marketing at NTO, wants to receive daily reports of emails that were sent so he can track email performance. He asks Paulo, NTO’s marketing specialist, to create it for him. Let’s see how he can easily create the report from scratch.

Create a Scheduled Report

Reports are created and maintained in the Reports tab in Datorama Reports. Once there, Paulo clicks Create New Report and defines the report as follows.

He selects Excel as the Export Format.
He defines the time period. By default, pulls data for the last 30 days.
He sets the Measurement as Email Delivery Rate (since he wants to see how many emails were actually delivered).
He sets the Dimension as Send Date (since he wants to see the emails that were sent each day).



Since he wants to create a scheduled report he also performs the following steps.

He goes to the Report Scheduling area and selects the Active checkbox to enable all the options.
Since Ralph requested a daily report, he sets the Frequency as daily.
He then sets the Delivery Hour as 10 PM.
In the Delivery Method he selects Email since he wants Ralph to receive the reports via email.
He enters Ralph’s email as the recipient.
He clicks Add as New Scheduler to apply the schedule to the report.



View Report History

The report history log displays a list of all the times the report ran and provides information about each report execution, such as whether the run was successful, the start and end dates of the execution, and so on. You can use the report history when you want to monitor your reports—to see if any jobs failed and why, for example. You can also use report history to explore your report executions, for things like downloading report outputs. 
You can find the report history log in the Reports page by clicking a report, and then clicking History. A list appears with all the report executions. Each time a report runs, a new job is executed and a new row appears in the list. From here you can edit the report’s configuration settings, delete a log from the list, refresh the report history and even run the report again. That’s it!

Sum It Up

In this module, you dove into Datorama Reports and learned how to analyze and optimize your email, push, and journey campaign-level data. By viewing real-life scenarios, you also saw how the NTO team—Isabelle, Paulo, and Ralph—used dashboards, pivot tables, and reports to view and manage their email campaigns and use their data to its fullest potential. We can’t wait to see how you use Datorama Reports to explore your own data!

It unites customer data with customer behaviors in real time to create more intelligent communications and interactions that respond to and anticipate customer needs. Every interaction drives personalized, 1-to-1 communications that move the customer along in their unique journey.

                    What is a customer journey?
                





A customer journey is a lifelong experience with your brand. It includes all touchpoints and impressions from interactions with your employees, visits to your website, experiences with your products, and beyond. Marketers can guide the customer journey like never before with cross-channel marketing strategies that combine digital and real-world experiences with your brand. The most successful companies create highly personalized and relevant content at scale across many channels to deliver 1-to-1 customer journeys.

                    What are the benefits of Marketing Cloud being cloud-based?
                





Marketing Cloud delivers data and application functionality through the web, rather than having them reside on a user’s desktop/laptop/mobile device, hardware drive, or in what is otherwise known as on-premise solutions.

As a result, IT departments no longer need to worry about buying and provisioning servers to hold company data and can instead focus on creating applications that help the business run faster. And they don’t have to worry about installing applications on every device for every user in a business. Instead, users with web access simply log on to an app to access, share, and collaborate on relevant data and business processes immediately.

Salesforce has been a leader in enterprise cloud computing since 1999, virtually creating the category. Today, Salesforce has more than 100,000 customers and continues to be a recognized leader in cloud computing for businesses of all sizes and in nearly every industry under the sun.

                    How does Marketing Cloud help achieve 1-to-1 personalization?
                





1-to-1 personalization is made possible at scale with a true 360-degree view of each individual customer. Marketing Cloud combines all data sources — including marketing, sales, and service — into individual contact records that are living, breathing, and constantly evolving. Every interaction with a customer — such as an email open, loyalty program registration, new-lead capture, in-store purchase, or service customer — adds to CRM data insights.

                    How does Marketing Cloud make customer data actionable?
                





Marketing Cloud does more than capture data — it makes it actionable in real time. This is made possible with Journey Builder, which enables marketers to plan, personalize, and optimize customer journeys across channels. Illustrate the customer journey, understand where customers are on their path, and automatically guide them to the next step by detecting triggers. Any change to an individual data record — such an app download — can elicit a pre-approved response, such as an in-app push message thanking the customer and providing tips for use.

                    What metrics are available through Marketing Cloud?
                





Marketing Cloud empowers marketers to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns. Each interaction can be aligned to a specific business goal, providing real-time insights toward attainment. At a more granular level, marketers can test different factors to optimize performance. What frequency produces the best results? On which channels? With what message? And perhaps most importantly, how can a marketer adjust and test combinations of each to improve performance going forward?

                    In what ways does Marketing Cloud influence Net Promoter Scores?
                





By leveraging intelligence-driven data throughout the customer lifecycle to deliver highly personalized messages across channels, Marketing Cloud positively influences customer perceptions of the brand. Benefits include increased customer satisfaction, increased purchases and renewals, greater referrals, and reduced churn.

                    What is Marketing Cloud’s contact model?
                





In order to build great individual experiences, you need great data. That’s where our contact model comes into play. We offer contact management tools so that you can build a 360-degree view of your customer — leveraging native and non-native data from any source. And with our segmentation tools, you can slice and dice the data to find the right audience. Our contact model includes a Predictive Intelligence engine that uses advanced algorithms to predict the optimal content and offers for each individual customer or prospect in your database based on that customer’s history and real-time actions.

                    Is Marketing Cloud part of Salesforce Customer 360?
                





	Yes. Marketing Cloud is a core component of Salesforce Customer 360. It operates alongside other clouds to complete the Customer 360: Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Community Cloud, Analytics Cloud, and App Cloud. The 1-to-1 customer journey remains a seamless experience across your departments — ensuring your ability to anticipate needs and enable your customers’ success.

                    What makes Marketing Cloud different from other clouds?
                





Across marketing, sales, and service, Marketing Cloud focuses on the 1-to-1 customer journey through all connected devices on every channel. Connect interactions from anywhere, combining customer data and behaviors to create relevant communications that are delivered in real time, on your customers’ terms.

                    How does Marketing Cloud differ from traditional marketing automation tactics?
                





Many organizations are not delivering data-driven interactions and experiences to their customers. Instead, these organizations communicate and interact with their customers through a series of disconnected, independent campaigns and messages — often across many organizational functions that are not coordinated, data-driven, or entirely purposeful.

                    Does Salesforce use Marketing Cloud for any of its own marketing campaigns?
                





Salesforce uses Marketing Cloud technology to drive powerful results in every business function. Employee acquisition and onboarding are automated with Marketing Cloud. Marketing Cloud provides sales teams with enablement materials and competitive insights, and joins with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud to send event messaging over all channels. Salesforce also uses Marketing Cloud to foster new customer relationships with product awareness, support at scale, and targeted communications. Marketing Cloud powers Salesforce’s cross-channel social strategy and digital ad campaigns, as well.

Marketing Cloud delivers data and application functionality through the web, rather than having them reside on a user’s desktop/laptop/mobile device, hardware drive, or in what is otherwise known as on-premise solutions.As a result,  departments no longer need to worry about buying and provisioning servers to hold company data and can instead focus on creating applications that help the business run faster. And they don’t have to worry about installing applications on every device for every user in a business. Instead, users with web access simply log on to an app to access, share, and collaborate on relevant data and business processes immediately.Salesforce has been a leader in enterprise cloud computing since 1999, virtually creating the category. Today, Salesforce has more than 100,000 customers and continues to be a recognized leader in cloud computing for businesses of all sizes and in nearly every industry under the sun.

Marketing Cloud connects discrete interactions, from any channel, on the customer’s terms. Every interaction drives personalized, 1-to-1 communications that move the customer along in their unique journey. Marketing Cloud delivers data and application functionality through the web, rather than having them reside on a user’s desktop/laptop/mobile device, hardware drive, or in what is otherwise known as on-premise solutions.As a result,  departments no longer need to worry about buying and provisioning servers to hold company data and can instead focus on creating applications that help the business run faster. Instead, users with web access simply log on to an app to access, share, and collaborate on relevant data and business processes immediately.Salesforce has been a leader in enterprise cloud computing since 1999, virtually creating the category. Today, Salesforce has more than 100,000 customers and continues to be a recognized leader in cloud computing for businesses of all sizes and in nearly every industry under the sun. Whether the right channel at a specific moment is email, mobile, social, ads, in-app, or the web, today’s digital business leaders have a ready-made conduit to engage across marketing, sales, and service. The plan is not just for specific moments in time based on a single event, but instead for the entire customer lifecycle, which can unfold in a coordinated series of events and interactions based on individual customer behavior and your business objectives. Marketing Cloud offers hundreds of features to help you execute on every possible communication, from basic email marketing strategies to sophisticated campaigns using Predictive Intelligence. With dynamic content blocks for personalization, integrated and automated predictive decisions, and predefined event triggers, you can automatically send relevant messages at any time during the customer lifecycle.

For example, quickly get leads from Facebook to your sales department, concerns or queries from Twitter to your customer service department, or requests for new features or advice to your tech support specialists — all automatically and immediately. Marketing Cloud has strategic partnerships with all of the major social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest, and Google+.Marketing Cloud is one of the select few Facebook Strategic Preferred Marketing Developers, where we gain early access to prelaunch product tests and sit on the  executive council.Salesforce is also the only company to be a charter member of both the Facebook Strategic Partner Program as well as Twitter’s Ads  program.As a launch partner of Pinterest’s MarTech Developer Alpha, Marketing Cloud has access to the Pinterest Business Insights , providing marketers with data to better understand their brands’ effectiveness on Pinterest.Selected as a LinkedIn Sponsored Updates partner, Marketing Cloud enables marketers to efficiently manage multiple campaigns, target premium audiences at scale with LinkedIn’s unique demographic data, schedule Sponsored Updates, and track and optimize advertising campaign performance using rich reporting dashboards.

With Social.com and Active Audiences, you can leverage your  data to target customers and elusive lookalikes at scale. With Social.com, you can reach customers on any device or channel with identity-based targeting via Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram.

Track user behavior online, and automate messaging based on your customers’ individual preferences — giving you the ability to create and deliver relevant and personalized content to each and every customer without the hours and expense of manual work. Marketing Cloud includes tools to manage all of your assets, and support workflows, approvals, and even versioning. Marketing Cloud combines all data sources — including marketing, sales, and service — into individual contact records that are living, breathing, and constantly evolving. Every interaction with a customer — such as an email open, loyalty program registration, new-lead capture, in-store purchase, or service customer — adds to  data insights. This is made possible with Journey Builder, which enables marketers to plan, personalize, and optimize customer journeys across channels. Any change to an individual data record — such an app download — can elicit a pre-approved response, such as an in-app push message thanking the customer and providing tips for use. By leveraging intelligence-driven data throughout the customer lifecycle to deliver highly personalized messages across channels, Marketing Cloud positively influences customer perceptions of the brand. 24-Hour Technical SupportOur dedicated Audience Studio Client Services Team is available 24 hours a day, every day, to support Salesforce customers.

See collaboration between Marketing, Sales, and Service Clouds                                  What makes Marketing Cloud different from other clouds? Across marketing, sales, and service, Marketing Cloud focuses on the 1-to-1 customer journey through all connected devices on every channel. Connect interactions from anywhere, combining customer data and behaviors to create relevant communications that are delivered in real time, on your customers’ terms. Instead, these organizations communicate and interact with their customers through a series of disconnected, independent campaigns and messages — often across many organizational functions that are not coordinated, data-driven, or entirely purposeful. Marketing Cloud provides sales teams with enablement materials and competitive insights, and joins with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud to send event messaging over all channels. Salesforce also uses Marketing Cloud to foster new customer relationships with product awareness, support at scale, and targeted communications. Marketing Cloud powers Salesforce’s cross-channel social strategy and digital ad campaigns, as well.

                WeddingWire makes a commitment to personalized, customer-focused marketing. 
            
            
            
            
        



A decade ago, planning a wedding meant calling vendors, physically visiting a venue, and announcing your engagement in the newspaper. Now 30% of engaged couples plan their wedding from a tablet or mobile device, and one in four couples use at least two apps for wedding planning, inspiration, organization, or connecting with other couples.
As the leading technology company serving the $200 billion wedding, corporate, and social events industry, WeddingWire has built its success on innovation and meeting the changing needs of its customers.
The key to this strategy is a forward-thinking business model focused squarely on customer preference, education, and communication. WeddingWire employs Email Studio to create customer email journeys. They are also a heavy user of Mobile Studio, producing SMS campaigns, and dynamically generated content based on user behavior, giving the company the ability to maximize user experience while providing personalization tailored to the needs of its customers.
“We’re constantly trying to get better because every engaged couple is different,” said Email Marketing Specialist Bethany Mulcahy.
When users joins WeddingWire, they provide their email address and wedding date. With the wedding date as the starting point, the company can predict, for example, when an engaged couple might be ready to pick a venue.
The same experience is repeated for other key planning milestones, such as selecting a wedding dress or photographer. This predictable customer journey gives WeddingWire the opportunity to provide relevant and engaging content for its customers. WeddingWire also uses email to onboard vendors and offer education and information tailored to their specific industry. An advertising program gives the vendors additional opportunities to showcase their services to WeddingWire clients.
“We send a lot of emails to vendors about educational opportunities, as well as a biweekly newsletter that relies on a lot on AMPscript to personalize for region, advertising package, and industry,” said Bart Thornburg, Senior Manager of Email Marketing.



 
    










            
                Since launching the WedSocial email series and MobileConnect campaign, adoption of the WedSocial app among WeddingWire users is up 74%. 
            
            
            
            
        











            
                Finding the right match 
            
            
            
            
        



WeddingWire has parlayed the focus on user experience to successfully integrate mobile technology. At its vendor conference, WeddingWire World, the company uses MobileConnect, found in Mobile Studio, to text attendees information on Wi-Fi passwords, meeting locations, and swag giveaways.
WeddingWire also uses MobileConnect to drive adoption of its WedSocial app. The app allows wedding attendees to upload personal photos taken during the wedding to share with all attendees and also provides wedding information, such as rehearsal dinner and reception location.
Adoption of the WedSocial app is driven through a series of promotional emails directed toward the engaged couple. Critical in the series, which begins 30 days prior to the nuptials, is a table card email, sent to the couple 17 days prior to the event. The email encourages them to print custom table cards to be displayed at the wedding.
The table cards include an SMS shortcode and keyword generated by MobileConnect, making it easy for guests to simply text in for a link to download WedSocial. The link they receive is customized for the device, directing them to either Google Play or the Apple App Store.
The table card emails solved for a common pain point. “It’s always a challenge to connect people from something in the physical world to something in the digital world,” Thornburg said. “It’s a jump from one medium to another and SMS proved a really good way to bridge that gap.”
The results speak for themselves. Since launching the WedSocial email series and MobileConnect campaign, adoption of the WedSocial app among WeddingWire users is up 74%.
“Marketing Cloud allows us to be really focused on the experience of our community,” said Thornburg.

Now 30% of engaged couples plan their wedding from a tablet or mobile device, and one in four couples use at least two apps for wedding planning, inspiration, organization, or connecting with other couples.As the leading technology company serving the $200 billion wedding, corporate, and social events industry, WeddingWire has built its success on innovation and meeting the changing needs of its customers.The key to this strategy is a forward-thinking business model focused squarely on customer preference, education, and communication. They are also a heavy user of Mobile Studio, producing  campaigns, and dynamically generated content based on user behavior, giving the company the ability to maximize user experience while providing personalization tailored to the needs of its customers.“We’re constantly trying to get better because every engaged couple is different,” said Email Marketing Specialist Bethany Mulcahy.When users joins WeddingWire, they provide their email address and wedding date. An advertising program gives the vendors additional opportunities to showcase their services to WeddingWire clients.“We send a lot of emails to vendors about educational opportunities, as well as a biweekly newsletter that relies on a lot on script to personalize for region, advertising package, and industry,” said Bart Thornburg, Senior Manager of Email Marketing. Since launching the WedSocial email series and MobileConnect campaign, adoption of the WedSocial app among WeddingWire users is up 74%. At its vendor conference, WeddingWire World, the company uses MobileConnect, found in Mobile Studio, to text attendees information on Wi-Fi passwords, meeting locations, and swag giveaways.WeddingWire also uses MobileConnect to drive adoption of its WedSocial app. The app allows wedding attendees to upload personal photos taken during the wedding to share with all attendees and also provides wedding information, such as rehearsal dinner and reception location.Adoption of the WedSocial app is driven through a series of promotional emails directed toward the engaged couple. The email encourages them to print custom table cards to be displayed at the wedding.The table cards include an  shortcode and keyword generated by MobileConnect, making it easy for guests to simply text in for a link to download WedSocial.

                Pacers Sports & Entertainment uses digital to champion its global NBA brand. 
            
            
            
            
        



The National Basketball Association has grown into a global phenomenon in recent years, with NBA broadcasts reaching more than 200 countries. The NBA currently staffs a dozen international offices and runs seven player academies on four continents. ""I believe we can be the #1 sport in the world,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said. 
In the spirit of that vision, the Indiana Pacers has deployed Salesforce to enrich and personalize digital interactions with every Pacers fan on the planet. The objective is to create the “Ultimate Indiana Pacers Fan Experience” for every fan of the team, no matter where that fan may be.





            
                Pacers Sports & Entertainment is a Trailblazer in customer engagement. 
            
            
            
            
        



With 1.1 million followers on Twitter and 3.2 million fans on Facebook, the Pacers’ fan base extends far beyond the 18,000 seats in the Pacers’ home court. The Pacers’ parent company, Pacers Sports & Entertainment (PS&E), has expanded its use of Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud, and Tableau CRM to engage with Pacers fans before, during, and after games via email and social media channels.
""With Salesforce, we're bringing digital to the forefront of the fan experience,” said Rick Fuson, President and Chief Operating Officer of PS&E. “We’re using innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence to better engage with our fans when and how they want, with content that is highly personalized to them.""










 
    







            
                Personalized messaging yields revenue results. 
            
            
            
            
        



As recently as 2016, the Pacers marketing team might spend hours building a single email list from disparate spreadsheets. Now, with Marketing Cloud, the team automates audience segmentation based each season-ticket subscriber’s engagement history across multiple touchpoints. Journey Builder, Marketing Cloud’s marketing orchestration and automation engine, enables the Pacers’ digital team to send highly personalized emails to anyone who engages with the brand.
“Journey Builder has been particularly huge for us,” said Derek Throneburg, VP of Customer Insight and Engagement. “It changed our process, and as we’ve mastered the functionality, the segmentation has had huge impacts for our revenue.” With Customer 360 Audiences, Social Studio, and Ad Studio, the PS&E digital team is able to more precisely engage fans with relevant content, information, and special offers across social media and digital advertising.
“We have transitioned a little bit from simply looking at email as the primary outbound messaging to really looking at the hub of ways that we can reach our customers and fans,” said Alana Galardo, Associate Director of Consumer Engagement. “A campaign for us that might have once been just email may now be a combination of email and social posts.”



 
    




            
                Smart email scoring boosts engagement results. 
            
            
            
            
        



PS&E uses Einstein to engage new fans on social media, personalize email content leading up to games, and push real-time offers during games through the Pacers mobile app.
 Einstein Engagement Scoring for email has created a steady 20% increase in engagement through personalized messaging, while allowing quicker turnaround time on sending emails. Through Einstein, the Pacers’ marketing team can be more strategic in developing new relevant content, based on email behavior. They’ve enjoyed an incremental increase in the size of their loyalist category of fans and a significant drop in the number of dormant accounts. 
“Einstein Engagement Scoring is an incredibly powerful tool,” said Throneburg, He noted that a recent email surveyed accounts Einstein had scored as dormant for the type of information they would like to get from the Pacers. With an open rate of over 10%, the survey responses have yielded valuable new insights about the kinds of email subscribers want to receive. “Now we can start to personalize and customize that content,” Throneburg said. “We’re weaving that into our creative strategy, we’re weaving it into our email strategy, and then that will start to spill over across other channels, as well.”

PS&E is also increasing its use of Service Cloud, in conjunction with Marketing Cloud, to transform customer experiences. For example, if a fan tweets about an issue while attending a game, a customer service representative will be notified who can resolve the issue right at the fan’s seat in the Pacers’ home arena, Bankers Life Fieldhouse. 
Salesforce integration allows digital marketers using Marketing Cloud to benefit from Pacers’ ticket sales data stored on Service Cloud. “We use Service Cloud as kind of our database of record. It’s been incredibly valuable,” said Throneburg. 
With the recent addition of MuleSoft AnyPoint Platform, the marketing team will be able to pull together data from ticket systems, food and beverage systems, and mobile app behavior. “All of these things are living in their own silos,” said Throneburg. “We’re working with MuleSoft now to help connect the dots on some of those pieces that will allow us to take essentially every field of data, make it actionable, and help drive our business forward.” 
PS&E’s holdings also include the Indiana Fever of the Women’s Basketball League, the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA G League, Pacers Gaming of the NBA 2K League, Bankers Life Fieldhouse, and the Pacers Foundation. Future plans include implementing the same digital experiences through Salesforce across this entire portfolio of teams and brands. Said Throneburg, “We are able to drive marketing engagement with our fans by using Salesforce to bring to life all our ideas, thoughts, and strategies.”

The National Basketball Association has grown into a global phenomenon in recent years, with  broadcasts reaching more than 200 countries. The  currently staffs a dozen international offices and runs seven player academies on four continents. ""I believe we can be the #1 sport in the world,""  Commissioner Adam Silver has said. In the spirit of that vision, the Indiana Pacers has deployed Salesforce to enrich and personalize digital interactions with every Pacers fan on the planet. The objective is to create the “Ultimate Indiana Pacers Fan Experience” for every fan of the team, no matter where that fan may be.                            Pacers Sports & Entertainment is a Trailblazer in customer engagement.                                                         With 1.1 million followers on Twitter and 3.2 million fans on Facebook, the Pacers’ fan base extends far beyond the 18,000 seats in the Pacers’ home court. The Pacers’ parent company, Pacers Sports & Entertainment (&E), has expanded its use of Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud, and Tableau  to engage with Pacers fans before, during, and after games via email and social media channels.""With Salesforce, we're bringing digital to the forefront of the fan experience,” said Rick Fuson, President and Chief Operating Officer of &E. “We’re using innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence to better engage with our fans when and how they want, with content that is highly personalized to them.""                                 Personalized messaging yields revenue results.                                                         As recently as 2016, the Pacers marketing team might spend hours building a single email list from disparate spreadsheets. Now, with Marketing Cloud, the team automates audience segmentation based each season-ticket subscriber’s engagement history across multiple touchpoints. Journey Builder, Marketing Cloud’s marketing orchestration and automation engine, enables the Pacers’ digital team to send highly personalized emails to anyone who engages with the brand.“Journey Builder has been particularly huge for us,” said Derek Throneburg,  of Customer Insight and Engagement. “It changed our process, and as we’ve mastered the functionality, the segmentation has had huge impacts for our revenue.” With Customer 360 Audiences, Social Studio, and Ad Studio, the &E digital team is able to more precisely engage fans with relevant content, information, and special offers across social media and digital advertising.“We have transitioned a little bit from simply looking at email as the primary outbound messaging to really looking at the hub of ways that we can reach our customers and fans,” said Alana Galardo, Associate Director of Consumer Engagement. “A campaign for us that might have once been just email may now be a combination of email and social posts.”                                 Smart email scoring boosts engagement results.                                                         &E uses Einstein to engage new fans on social media, personalize email content leading up to games, and push real-time offers during games through the Pacers mobile app. Einstein Engagement Scoring for email has created a steady 20% increase in engagement through personalized messaging, while allowing quicker turnaround time on sending emails. Through Einstein, the Pacers’ marketing team can be more strategic in developing new relevant content, based on email behavior. They’ve enjoyed an incremental increase in the size of their loyalist category of fans and a significant drop in the number of dormant accounts. “Einstein Engagement Scoring is an incredibly powerful tool,” said Throneburg, He noted that a recent email surveyed accounts Einstein had scored as dormant for the type of information they would like to get from the Pacers. With an open rate of over 10%, the survey responses have yielded valuable new insights about the kinds of email subscribers want to receive. “Now we can start to personalize and customize that content,” Throneburg said. “We’re weaving that into our creative strategy, we’re weaving it into our email strategy, and then that will start to spill over across other channels, as well.”                                 Discover insights, predict outcomes, and find recommendations with Tableau .                                                                                        Watch Demo                                                                    Customer engagement meets fans wherever they are, in real time.                                                         &E is also increasing its use of Service Cloud, in conjunction with Marketing Cloud, to transform customer experiences. For example, if a fan tweets about an issue while attending a game, a customer service representative will be notified who can resolve the issue right at the fan’s seat in the Pacers’ home arena, Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Salesforce integration allows digital marketers using Marketing Cloud to benefit from Pacers’ ticket sales data stored on Service Cloud. “We use Service Cloud as kind of our database of record. It’s been incredibly valuable,” said Throneburg. With the recent addition of MuleSoft AnyPoint Platform, the marketing team will be able to pull together data from ticket systems, food and beverage systems, and mobile app behavior. “All of these things are living in their own silos,” said Throneburg. “We’re working with MuleSoft now to help connect the dots on some of those pieces that will allow us to take essentially every field of data, make it actionable, and help drive our business forward.” &E’s holdings also include the Indiana Fever of the Women’s Basketball League, the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the  G League, Pacers Gaming of the  2K League, Bankers Life Fieldhouse, and the Pacers Foundation. Future plans include implementing the same digital experiences through Salesforce across this entire portfolio of teams and brands. Said Throneburg, “We are able to drive marketing engagement with our fans by using Salesforce to bring to life all our ideas, thoughts, and strategies.”                                  Keep exploring stories like this one.

                Priority Health partnered with Professional Services to accelerate digital transformation. 
            
            
            
            
        
























As COVID-19 worsened, the healthcare sector rapidly turned its attention to how to continue providing quality healthcare to patients during the crisis. Innovations such as tele-health consultations, wearable devices, and the use of advanced data analytics to model scenarios were embraced. Now, as organizations consider what comes next, the challenge is how to continue to build on that innovation to create better healthcare outcomes.
As a nonprofit health plan company, Priority Health is tackling this challenge head-on. As the fastest growing provider of health plans in Michigan, Priority Health knew it needed to innovate and scale to meet the changing needs of its over one million members. But disconnected systems and applications meant the company did not have the complete view of members needed to realize its digital transformation and growth goals.
Priority Health’s leadership recognized that it needed a partner that could help it integrate its core systems to unlock a 360-degree view of its members, opening the door to innovation. It also needed a more strategic approach to achieving its long-term objectives. The company turned to the Salesforce Customer Success Group, including Professional Services and its Premier Success Plan, for help.
Here are four lessons from Priority Health’s digital transformation that might help your organization create better, more personalized customer experiences.

Lesson 2: Create self-serve solutions to ease administrative bottlenecks

With member data stored in multiple systems, Priority Health’s customer service representatives often found themselves speaking to members without knowing their history with the company. This meant members were often forced to repeat their story each time they made a call. Members also often experienced delays as service representatives switched between systems to find the information they needed.
Priority Health partnered with a team of digital transformation experts from Salesforce Professional Services to help unite its sales, service, and marketing teams on a single, scalable customer relationship management (CRM) platform.
In addition to helping the company plan for long-term sustainable success, this Professional Services team was also on hand to help guide Priority Health through the critical moments of implementing its new technology solution.
With member data now available on a single customer engagement platform, Priority Health’s customer service representatives begin every interaction fully informed. This allows them to work more efficiently across all member touchpoints, deliver better member experiences, and help members to achieve better health outcomes.
Automated workflows built into the platform minimize redundant tasks, saving time and allowing service representatives to engage with members more effectively from the outset of every call.
“Salesforce’s Professional Services was phenomenal,” said Stella Michael, Director of CRM Platforms at Priority Health.
“They did a really great job in bringing the teams together and clearly articulating what we need to do to design a solution that is scalable, reliable, and maintainable. They had clarity of thought, were aligned to our business vision, and built a quality solution.”

Priority Health works with a large network of agents nationally. However, legacy manual processes meant onboarding new agents took up to 10 days to finalize. Once approved, agents did not have any visibility into their historical list of clients or requests for quotes.
With help from Salesforce Professional Services, Priority Health has developed a new agent portal for their health plan enrollment using industry-specific cloud and mobile software. This enables agents to self-initiate the onboarding process, complete a step-by-step enrollment, and submit their application 60% faster than before.
The agent portal is also a one-stop-shop for agents to access existing applications, commission statements, lists of clients, and guided flows for submitting requests.
With agents now able to find information they need when they need it, the company has seen a reduction in the overall time it takes for them to match the best health plan policies for members.

Throughout the project, Priority Health partnered with Salesforce Professional Services, who worked closely with the company’s project team to help it customize its roadmap and achieve its long-term objectives.
Members of the project team have also had expert coaching sessions included as part of its Premier Success Plan.
These sessions allow team members to build their expertise and understanding of how to use Salesforce products and capabilities with confidence.
“The Premier Success team was proactive about helping us out from the start,” said Stella. “As we started maturing internally, attending conferences, and sharpening our skills, we were able to learn about specific topics that interested us through their expert coaching sessions. It was a great partnership.”

","Priority Health Creates Personalized Experiences with Salesforce - Salesforce.comSkip to content                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Priority Health Creates Personalized Experiences with Salesforce                                                                                     Priority Health partnered with Professional Services to accelerate digital transformation.                                                         As -19 worsened, the healthcare sector rapidly turned its attention to how to continue providing quality healthcare to patients during the crisis. Innovations such as tele-health consultations, wearable devices, and the use of advanced data analytics to model scenarios were embraced. Now, as organizations consider what comes next, the challenge is how to continue to build on that innovation to create better healthcare outcomes.As a nonprofit health plan company, Priority Health is tackling this challenge head-on. As the fastest growing provider of health plans in Michigan, Priority Health knew it needed to innovate and scale to meet the changing needs of its over one million members. But disconnected systems and applications meant the company did not have the complete view of members needed to realize its digital transformation and growth goals.Priority Health’s leadership recognized that it needed a partner that could help it integrate its core systems to unlock a 360-degree view of its members, opening the door to innovation. It also needed a more strategic approach to achieving its long-term objectives. The company turned to the Salesforce Customer Success Group, including Professional Services and its Premier Success Plan, for help.Here are four lessons from Priority Health’s digital transformation that might help your organization create better, more personalized customer experiences.                                           Table of Contents                                                         Lesson 1: Unlock better customer experience with a single view of customersLesson 2: Create self-serve solutions to ease administrative bottlenecksLesson 3: Leverage automation to create tailored marketing journeysLesson 4: Choose partners who can support you at every step                                           1. Unlock better customer experience with a single view of customers                                                         With member data stored in multiple systems, Priority Health’s customer service representatives often found themselves speaking to members without knowing their history with the company. This meant members were often forced to repeat their story each time they made a call. Members also often experienced delays as service representatives switched between systems to find the information they needed.Priority Health partnered with a team of digital transformation experts from Salesforce Professional Services to help unite its sales, service, and marketing teams on a single, scalable customer relationship management () platform.In addition to helping the company plan for long-term sustainable success, this Professional Services team was also on hand to help guide Priority Health through the critical moments of implementing its new technology solution.With member data now available on a single customer engagement platform, Priority Health’s customer service representatives begin every interaction fully informed. This allows them to work more efficiently across all member touchpoints, deliver better member experiences, and help members to achieve better health outcomes.Automated workflows built into the platform minimize redundant tasks, saving time and allowing service representatives to engage with members more effectively from the outset of every call.“Salesforce’s Professional Services was phenomenal,” said Stella Michael, Director of  Platforms at Priority Health.“They did a really great job in bringing the teams together and clearly articulating what we need to do to design a solution that is scalable, reliable, and maintainable. They had clarity of thought, were aligned to our business vision, and built a quality solution.”                                        Learn about Professional Services                                                 Learn about Service Cloud                                                    “Salesforce Professional Services was phenomenal. They did a really great job in bringing the teams together and clearly articulating what we need to do to design a solution that is scalable, reliable, and maintainable. They had clarity of thought, were aligned to our business vision, and built a quality solution.”                                                                                      Stella Michael                                                         Director of  Platforms                                      2. Create self-serve solutions to ease administrative bottlenecks                                                         Priority Health works with a large network of agents nationally. However, legacy manual processes meant onboarding new agents took up to 10 days to finalize. Once approved, agents did not have any visibility into their historical list of clients or requests for quotes.With help from Salesforce Professional Services, Priority Health has developed a new agent portal for their health plan enrollment using industry-specific cloud and mobile software. This enables agents to self-initiate the onboarding process, complete a step-by-step enrollment, and submit their application 60% faster than before.The agent portal is also a one-stop-shop for agents to access existing applications, commission statements, lists of clients, and guided flows for submitting requests.With agents now able to find information they need when they need it, the company has seen a reduction in the overall time it takes for them to match the best health plan policies for members.          60%                            reduction in agent                             onboarding time                                                                                                 Learn about Professional Services                                                 Learn about Health Cloud                                                      Learn about Sales Cloud                                                 Learn about Experience Cloud                                          3. Leverage automation to create tailored marketing journeys                                                         To help it deliver tailored personalized experiences to members, Priority Health is using digital marketing automation to deliver omni-channel outbound marketing messages.

The company turned to the Salesforce Customer Success Group, including Professional Services and its Premier Success Plan, for help.Here are four lessons from Priority Health’s digital transformation that might help your organization create better, more personalized customer experiences. Unlock better customer experience with a single view of customers                                                         With member data stored in multiple systems, Priority Health’s customer service representatives often found themselves speaking to members without knowing their history with the company. Members also often experienced delays as service representatives switched between systems to find the information they needed.Priority Health partnered with a team of digital transformation experts from Salesforce Professional Services to help unite its sales, service, and marketing teams on a single, scalable customer relationship management () platform.In addition to helping the company plan for long-term sustainable success, this Professional Services team was also on hand to help guide Priority Health through the critical moments of implementing its new technology solution.With member data now available on a single customer engagement platform, Priority Health’s customer service representatives begin every interaction fully informed. This allows them to work more efficiently across all member touchpoints, deliver better member experiences, and help members to achieve better health outcomes.Automated workflows built into the platform minimize redundant tasks, saving time and allowing service representatives to engage with members more effectively from the outset of every call.“Salesforce’s Professional Services was phenomenal,” said Stella Michael, Director of  Platforms at Priority Health.“They did a really great job in bringing the teams together and clearly articulating what we need to do to design a solution that is scalable, reliable, and maintainable. Once approved, agents did not have any visibility into their historical list of clients or requests for quotes.With help from Salesforce Professional Services, Priority Health has developed a new agent portal for their health plan enrollment using industry-specific cloud and mobile software. This enables agents to self-initiate the onboarding process, complete a step-by-step enrollment, and submit their application 60% faster than before.The agent portal is also a one-stop-shop for agents to access existing applications, commission statements, lists of clients, and guided flows for submitting requests.With agents now able to find information they need when they need it, the company has seen a reduction in the overall time it takes for them to match the best health plan policies for members. Leverage automation to create tailored marketing journeys                                                         To help it deliver tailored personalized experiences to members, Priority Health is using digital marketing automation to deliver omni-channel outbound marketing messages. Marketing automation makes it simpler for marketing teams to identify, segment, and target specific groups among its membership for tailored and actionable communications.It also makes it easier for team members to optimize content, increase the visibility of campaign performance among stakeholders, and report on campaign successes.Priority Health is also using data monitoring and encryption tools to ensure customers’ data remains confidential and enhance compliance and governance across the entire platform. Choose partners who can support you at every step                                                         Throughout the project, Priority Health partnered with Salesforce Professional Services, who worked closely with the company’s project team to help it customize its roadmap and achieve its long-term objectives.Members of the project team have also had expert coaching sessions included as part of its Premier Success Plan.These sessions allow team members to build their expertise and understanding of how to use Salesforce products and capabilities with confidence.“The Premier Success team was proactive about helping us out from the start,” said Stella. It was a great partnership.”                                                                                      Stella Michael                                                         Director of  Platforms                                 More Resources                                                              Personalized Healthcare: Moments That Matter                             Guide                                                                                     Personalization: Before, During, and After                                                         Personalized Healthcare: Moments That Matter Data Integration | Guide to Scalable Data                            Guide                                                                                     Unlock, Analyze, and Act on Your Data                                                         Data Integration | Guide to Scalable DataHow Bentley Motors Is Reimagining Its Customer Experience for the Next 100 Years                            Customer story                                                                                     How Bentley Motors Is Reimagining Its Customer Experience for the Next 100 Years                                                         How Bentley Motors Is Reimagining Its Customer Experience for the Next 100 Years                                      Get timely updates and fresh ideas delivered to your inbox.

	By Ritika Puri; You think your customers are happy. But have you ever taken a step back to evaluate (and quantify) what they aren’t telling you?; Customer satisfaction is one of the toughest, most abstract concepts to capture and measure. Satisfaction is often in the eye of the beholder, and if you’re using a tool like a survey, you’re relying on self-reported data that presents only one side of the story. In addition, “success” is multi-faceted: A customer may be happy overall, but there may be some hidden deal-breakers that are hurting your retention metrics.; So how do you tackle this challenge and improve your customer satisfaction scores? The short answer: Measure success from a few different dimensions. In addition to understanding why your customers are happy, you should focus on specific elements that contribute to overall success.










            
                Step 1: Assess Whether You’re Delivering on Your Promises 
            
            
            
            
        



Customer satisfaction is a tricky concept to measure because there are a number of reasons why a person may feel happy or unhappy about a purchase. You may have a great product or service, but your customers will feel frustrated if they’re dealing with long hold times for support.
One way to uncover more nuance is to reframe how you quantify happiness. Instead of looking at a composite score, ask yourself the more fundamental business question, “Are we delivering on the promises we make?”
In the B2B and SaaS world, there are generally three focus areas that contribute to long-term customer success:

Whether your company delivers on promises made during sales pitches
If your products and services help your customers achieve their goals
Whether your customers are receiving the ongoing support that they need for success with your company

You need to be able to measure a concept as abstract as a promise. And you have to accurately capture the dimensions above. To accomplish these goals, ask three very distinct families of questions in your satisfaction surveys. Have your customers rate, on a scale from 1-10:

Help desk quality
Promises from your sales team
Performance of your products and services

With this perspective, you’ll have opinion-based, actionable metrics. If you see that you rank low based on promises from your sales team, you know you need to adjust your messaging or make changes to your product. Should satisfaction scores about your help desk fall below 7, you may decide to create more self-serve options.
By breaking up your customer satisfaction scores into their different components, you’ll be able to see what’s working well and what isn’t—and focus on the right improvement drivers as a result.





            
                Step 2: Read Between the Lines 
            
            
            
            
        



	Opinion surveys are valuable for answering tough-business questions head on. But they’re also prone to a well-studied phenomenon called response bias—the tendency for survey respondents to exaggerate answers or report upon what they think they want survey administrators to hear. The best way to counteract response bias is to figure out what your customers aren’t telling you. That’s where the magic of analytics enters the picture.








Most likely, you’re already collecting a treasure trove of information about your audiences. Between your Google Analytics account and your CRM, you’re monitoring key actions they’re taking, as well as points of friction that may keep them from accomplishing their goals.
Just as you did in the first step, make sure you focus on the right metrics. Here are a few ideas to spark your data collection and analytics process:

The amount of time your customers spend on hold with your support reps
The number of support articles your audience reads per month
Time spent with each support article
Time to resolution
Number of calls required until the customer achieves a resolution
Satisfaction after calls with support agents

Put yourself in each customer’s shoes. What have been your favorite support experiences? What have been your least favorite? Focus on these two questions to determine exactly what you should be measuring.





            
                Step 3: Cover Your Bases 
            
            
            
            
        



When it comes to customer satisfaction, you need more than a one-size-fits-all approach. Most likely, your users, audiences, and partners are engaging with your brand through multiple channels. In measuring customer satisfaction, make sure you cover your bases to assess every potential touch point with your business.

In person: Make sure that you check in with and measure customer success at the right frequency. Administer an opinion survey to collect feedback.
Phone: Determine whether you’re reaching out to your customers at the right frequency while ensuring that you’re spending discussion time efficiently. Administer an opinion survey and collect data between the lines by measuring average wait times and using voice-based analytics to measure key phrases like “it works” and “awesome.”
Social media: Ensure that you respond to customer questions quickly and that you’re redirecting them to the right channels. Also make sure you’re presenting the right public-facing persona as a company that is helpful, transparent, and takes customer concerns seriously. Collect data around sentiment and focus on the time it takes to answer questions.
Your website: Make it easy for your customers to reach out with their questions, comments, and concerns. Run a mix of usability tests and opinion surveys to make sure customer success resources are easy to access. Use your web analytics to determine how much time audiences are spending with your content and whether they demonstrate any browsing patterns.

Focus on each channel individually so you can create a complete customer satisfaction picture and identify clear areas of improvement. Pay attention to a mix of what your customers are and aren’t telling you.










            
                Step 4: Mind the Gaps 
            
            
            
            
        



The beauty of data is that it gets better over time. Statistics is a blend of art and science, which means there’s a degree of subjectivity (and human error) in the metrics that you’re collecting. As you continue to measure the performance of your customer satisfaction programs, you’ll start asking even more questions. In some cases, it may be impossible to answer these questions quantitatively based on the systems you’ve set up. Before changing your analytics strategy entirely, focus on a few non-quantitative methods including:

Conduct in-depth customer discovery sessions on the phone or in person
Actively ask customers to share feedback around your support articles
Ask for feedback within your product
Include open-ended response categories on all of your satisfaction surveys

The key is to give your customers an opportunity to express themselves in an unstructured way. This perspective helps you determine what details—and opportunities to improve your customer success process—could be slipping through the cracks. Remember the golden rule of research: You don’t know what you don’t know. So don’t make assumptions. Find the answers you need instead.
The beauty of this process is that it sets you up to identify actionable areas of improvement. Look for changes over time and pinpoint specific steps that you can take to better support your customers. Always question your metrics and find ways to iterate upon your KPIs. Your data should open up important discussions and identify clear areas for strategic improvement. Treat your analytics as living, breathing assets, and your customer satisfaction scores will skyrocket.

Should satisfaction scores about your help desk fall below 7, you may decide to create more self-serve options.By breaking up your customer satisfaction scores into their different components, you’ll be able to see what’s working well and what isn’t—and focus on the right improvement drivers as a result.                            Step 2: Read Between the Lines                                                         	Opinion surveys are valuable for answering tough-business questions head on. But they’re also prone to a well-studied phenomenon called response bias—the tendency for survey respondents to exaggerate answers or report upon what they think they want survey administrators to hear. The best way to counteract response bias is to figure out what your customers aren’t telling you. That’s where the magic of analytics enters the picture.Most likely, you’re already collecting a treasure trove of information about your audiences. Between your Google Analytics account and your , you’re monitoring key actions they’re taking, as well as points of friction that may keep them from accomplishing their goals.Just as you did in the first step, make sure you focus on the right metrics. Here are a few ideas to spark your data collection and analytics process:The amount of time your customers spend on hold with your support repsThe number of support articles your audience reads per monthTime spent with each support articleTime to resolutionNumber of calls required until the customer achieves a resolutionSatisfaction after calls with support agentsPut yourself in each customer’s shoes. What have been your favorite support experiences? What have been your least favorite? Focus on these two questions to determine exactly what you should be measuring.                            Step 3: Cover Your Bases                                                         When it comes to customer satisfaction, you need more than a one-size-fits-all approach. Most likely, your users, audiences, and partners are engaging with your brand through multiple channels. In measuring customer satisfaction, make sure you cover your bases to assess every potential touch point with your business.In person: Make sure that you check in with and measure customer success at the right frequency. Administer an opinion survey to collect feedback.Phone: Determine whether you’re reaching out to your customers at the right frequency while ensuring that you’re spending discussion time efficiently. Administer an opinion survey and collect data between the lines by measuring average wait times and using voice-based analytics to measure key phrases like “it works” and “awesome.”Social media: Ensure that you respond to customer questions quickly and that you’re redirecting them to the right channels. Also make sure you’re presenting the right public-facing persona as a company that is helpful, transparent, and takes customer concerns seriously. Collect data around sentiment and focus on the time it takes to answer questions.Your website: Make it easy for your customers to reach out with their questions, comments, and concerns. Run a mix of usability tests and opinion surveys to make sure customer success resources are easy to access. Use your web analytics to determine how much time audiences are spending with your content and whether they demonstrate any browsing patterns.Focus on each channel individually so you can create a complete customer satisfaction picture and identify clear areas of improvement. Pay attention to a mix of what your customers are and aren’t telling you.                            Step 4: Mind the Gaps                                                         The beauty of data is that it gets better over time. Statistics is a blend of art and science, which means there’s a degree of subjectivity (and human error) in the metrics that you’re collecting. As you continue to measure the performance of your customer satisfaction programs, you’ll start asking even more questions. In some cases, it may be impossible to answer these questions quantitatively based on the systems you’ve set up. Before changing your analytics strategy entirely, focus on a few non-quantitative methods including:Conduct in-depth customer discovery sessions on the phone or in personActively ask customers to share feedback around your support articlesAsk for feedback within your productInclude open-ended response categories on all of your satisfaction surveysThe key is to give your customers an opportunity to express themselves in an unstructured way. This perspective helps you determine what details—and opportunities to improve your customer success process—could be slipping through the cracks. Remember the golden rule of research: You don’t know what you don’t know. So don’t make assumptions. Find the answers you need instead.The beauty of this process is that it sets you up to identify actionable areas of improvement. Look for changes over time and pinpoint specific steps that you can take to better support your customers. Always question your metrics and find ways to iterate upon your s. Your data should open up important discussions and identify clear areas for strategic improvement. Treat your analytics as living, breathing assets, and your customer satisfaction scores will skyrocket.                                 How to provide incredible customer service                                                                                       Get the e-book                                          Best practices to help go beyond your customer service goals                                                                                       Get the e-book                                          See the trends that are shaping today’s customer service goals                                                                                       Get the e-book                                          6 Ways to Connect Your Entire Business Around the Customer                                                                                       Get the e-book                                               Related Articles                                                              Things to Know About Service Scheduling Software in 2018How to Develop Realistic Customer Service GoalsWhy You Need a  with Maintenance Scheduling SoftwareLeveraging Data and Relationships with Commercial Real Estate ustomer Relationship ManagementWhat is Cloud Computing?Sales Tools                                                                                       Call us at                                                                                      See all ways to contact us >                                                                                     New to Salesforce?

You may have a great product or service, but your customers will feel frustrated if they’re dealing with long hold times for support.One way to uncover more nuance is to reframe how you quantify happiness. Instead of looking at a composite score, ask yourself the more fundamental business question, “Are we delivering on the promises we make?”In the B2B and SaaS world, there are generally three focus areas that contribute to long-term customer success:Whether your company delivers on promises made during sales pitchesIf your products and services help your customers achieve their goalsWhether your customers are receiving the ongoing support that they need for success with your companyYou need to be able to measure a concept as abstract as a promise.

                Salesforce Reviews: What to Look For and Why Thousands Choose Salesforce CRM 
            
            
            
            
        



Businesses of all sizes, from startups and small businesses to medium-sized organizations and leading international corporations, know what the right CRM (customer relationship management) can do to maximize and grow your customer-focused operations. CRM and contact management are the proven way to increase productivity and drive results. 
But how do you choose the right CRM for your organization? A quick glance at CRM software review sites show why Salesforce is the #1 CRM for businesses of all sizes.





            
                Salesforce is the Market Leader in CRM. 
            
            
            
            
        



Industry analysts agree: Salesforce is the undisputed CRM market leader. Salesforce was ranked the #1 CRM in for the seventh consecutive year in 2020, growing its overall market share position and increasing its revenue more than any other CRM vendor. IDC’s Worldwide Semiannual Software Tracker, October 2020 also named Salesforce the market share leader in sales, customer service, marketing, model-driven application platforms and enterprise community applications.
Salesforce brings companies and customers together. The near-endless customization, extendability, and scalability of the Salesforce platform make it a great tool for businesses of all sizes. That said, this blog post is a great primer on specific ways Salesforce brings companies and customers together across sales, marketing, service, and all the rest of a company’s departments. 
With product offerings tailored to entrepreneurs, small and medium size businesses (SMBs), and larger organizations, Salesforce technology is built to support the way you work now, and to scale as your business grows. Salesforce reviews from customers across all industries and business sizes are a great place to learn first-hand what our solutions can do.





            
                What to look for in Salesforce reviews. 
            
            
            
            
        



	As you research CRM solutions for your business, keep these questions in mind. They represent common concerns customers of all sizes use to evaluate Salesforce solutions against the competition:





            
                Is Salesforce safe? 
            
            
            
            
        



	When it comes to trusting your business data to the hands of a software or services provider, safety should be priority number one. Trust is Salesforce’s #1 value, and ensuring the safety of customer data is one of the biggest ways we earn that trust. Look for mentions of data security and safety when browsing Salesforce reviews.





            
                What are the advantages of Salesforce? 
            
            
            
            
        



	What are the Salesforce Advantages? We put a lot of value in these five: innovation, platform, productivity, mobility, and community. As you research Salesforce reviews, ask yourself if the competition can compete across all five areas.





            
                How does Salesforce stack up to the competition? 
            
            
            
            
        



	Comparison shopping is a great way to see how different CRM solutions compare directly to one another in terms of features, benefits, and deficiencies. We did a little comparison shopping of our own to see how Salesforce stacks up to the competition — you can use our overview as a guide when doing your own research. In a nutshell, scalability, customizations, reporting and analytics, community, and trust are key areas where we think Salesforce really rises above our competitors.





            
                How much is Salesforce CRM?

“The one thing that Salesforce does that I was not expecting was to keep all of how I communicate and all of my files in one place,” she said. “If I write an email or save a contract, Essentials automatically pulls it into the system. So I have saved a great bit of time from not having to do that again.”

        - Gwendolyn Houston-Jack, Owner, G-Photography

        - Mazi Rasulnia, President and CEO, Pack Health

        - Jo Mouseelli, Co-Founder, President & CEO, Xtreme Lashes

        - Brian MacDonald, Chief Technology Officer, Paws En Route
        
        
    



“As we've made our transition to Salesforce we're able to work so much more cohesively as a team. We see the actual impact that this tool has had, as opposed to us just trying to, like, hack it and make it on our own.”

        - Bennett Bennett, Head of Customer Success and Support, Mashgin
        
        
    



“We needed a single cloud-based platform that could store all our data, run apps for every department, and deliver value to our clients. After a long, very detailed search, we found Salesforce provided all that, and more.”

        - Ali Moshfeghian, COO, Xtreme Lashes

        - Josh Batz, Chief Technology Officer, Fike Corp

“Online, just by nature, it is a little bit cold, a bit impersonal. Thanks to Salesforce, we were able to build customer journeys — to provide our individual customers with an experience that was as close as possible to their expectations and desires.”

        - Francesca Picchiò, Digital & CRM Program Manager, Brunello Cucinelli.
        
        
    



“There is something unique about the relationship we have with Salesforce. Because Salesforce immediately grasped the specificity of our project, of what we wanted to do. They also understood our need to break away from the mainstream, to think outside the box.”

        - Francesca Picchiò, Digital & CRM Program Manager, Brunello Cucinelli.

"," Software Reviews: See Why Thousands Chose Salesforce  - Salesforce.comSkip to content                                 Salesforce Reviews: What to Look For and Why Thousands Choose Salesforce                                                          Businesses of all sizes, from startups and small businesses to medium-sized organizations and leading international corporations, know what the right  (customer relationship management) can do to maximize and grow your customer-focused operations.  and contact management are the proven way to increase productivity and drive results. But how do you choose the right  for your organization? A quick glance at  software review sites show why Salesforce is the #1  for businesses of all sizes.                            Salesforce is the Market Leader in .                                                         Industry analysts agree: Salesforce is the undisputed  market leader. Salesforce was ranked the #1  in for the seventh consecutive year in 2020, growing its overall market share position and increasing its revenue more than any other  vendor. ’s Worldwide Semiannual Software Tracker, October 2020 also named Salesforce the market share leader in sales, customer service, marketing, model-driven application platforms and enterprise community applications.Salesforce brings companies and customers together. The near-endless customization, extendability, and scalability of the Salesforce platform make it a great tool for businesses of all sizes. That said, this blog post is a great primer on specific ways Salesforce brings companies and customers together across sales, marketing, service, and all the rest of a company’s departments. With product offerings tailored to entrepreneurs, small and medium size businesses (s), and larger organizations, Salesforce technology is built to support the way you work now, and to scale as your business grows. Salesforce reviews from customers across all industries and business sizes are a great place to learn first-hand what our solutions can do.                            What to look for in Salesforce reviews.                                                         	As you research  solutions for your business, keep these questions in mind. They represent common concerns customers of all sizes use to evaluate Salesforce solutions against the competition:                            Is Salesforce safe?                                                         	When it comes to trusting your business data to the hands of a software or services provider, safety should be priority number one. Trust is Salesforce’s #1 value, and ensuring the safety of customer data is one of the biggest ways we earn that trust. Look for mentions of data security and safety when browsing Salesforce reviews.                            What are the advantages of Salesforce?                                                         	What are the Salesforce Advantages? We put a lot of value in these five: innovation, platform, productivity, mobility, and community. As you research Salesforce reviews, ask yourself if the competition can compete across all five areas.                            How does Salesforce stack up to the competition?                                                         	Comparison shopping is a great way to see how different  solutions compare directly to one another in terms of features, benefits, and deficiencies. We did a little comparison shopping of our own to see how Salesforce stacks up to the competition — you can use our overview as a guide when doing your own research. In a nutshell, scalability, customizations, reporting and analytics, community, and trust are key areas where we think Salesforce really rises above our competitors.

Salesforce Reviews from s                                                         “The one thing that Salesforce does that I was not expecting was to keep all of how I communicate and all of my files in one place,” she said. “If I write an email or save a contract, Essentials automatically pulls it into the system. So I have saved a great bit of time from not having to do that again.”        - Gwendolyn Houston-Jack, Owner, G-Photography                    “It’s been amazing how truly committed Salesforce is to helping us grow ...

Being able to analyze everything from one database is so powerful. Salesforce is like a living, breathing, evolving organism, just like we are.”        - Jo Mouseelli, Co-Founder, President & , Xtreme Lashes                    “Essentials enabled our ability to run the business from remote locations during the -19 crisis and has allowed us to focus on adapting to the new realities of the pandemic and growing our business.”        - Brian MacDonald, Chief Technology Officer, Paws En Route                    “As we've made our transition to Salesforce we're able to work so much more cohesively as a team. We see the actual impact that this tool has had, as opposed to us just trying to, like, hack it and make it on our own.”        - Bennett Bennett, Head of Customer Success and Support, Mashgin                    “We needed a single cloud-based platform that could store all our data, run apps for every department, and deliver value to our clients. After a long, very detailed search, we found Salesforce provided all that, and more.”        - Ali Moshfeghian, , Xtreme Lashes                                                  Hear from more small business customers’ reviews of Salesforce                                          Salesforce Reviews from Large Businesses                                                         “We rolled out CarMax Curbside to the whole country — to thousands of associates and all our customers — in less than three weeks. All this was possible because of the Salesforce Customer 360’s ability to scale and allow us to move at great speed.”        - Shamim Mohammad, Chief Information and Technology Officer, CarMax                    “Real digital transformation can only happen when you have the proper alignment of your people and processes with your . And there is no better way to make that happen than to have everything in one native platform.”        - Josh Batz, Chief Technology Officer, Fike Corp                    “We’re even more conscious about looking at insights on a constant basis and pivoting our strategies as needed,” said Ekta. “Our digital transformation started with Salesforce and the hard work and investments are paying off.”        - Ekta Chopra, Chief Digital Officer,  Cosmetics                    “With a 360 degree view of the customer, we can create a single source of truth that allows us to create extraordinary experiences for our customers and that’s what we need moving forward.”        - Dr. Astrid Fontaine, Board Member for People, Digitalization and , Bentley Motors                    “Online, just by nature, it is a little bit cold, a bit impersonal.

                What is a Help Desk? 
            
            
            
            
        



Great customer support is essential to staying competitive, no matter what industry you’re in. Your company can have the best products, and lead the way in innovative business practices, but offering strong customer support is still a must.

Let’s get one thing straight up front: Today’s customers are large and in charge. We live in a consumer-centric time, where customers have the power to instantly rate, review, and rave about your offerings. Between social media, e-commerce, and review sites, customers can talk to and about you anytime and anywhere, and there’s always somebody listening. Companies have to be ready to field support requests and other customer queries whenever and wherever they arise.

This is where the help desk comes in.








              
                WATCH DEMO
              











                        It’s a desk where I get help. Right? 
                    





Help desks aren’t actually desks. Sometimes help desk means the people who work at the help desk, but sometimes it means the software those people use. And it only refers to helping people with technical problems. At least in our context. Confused yet? Totally understandable. So let’s break this down.
Help desk is defined as a tool or service for supporting computer users. We know what you’re thinking, your customers use phones, not PCs. Fair enough. Let’s update that to say, “supporting people using phones, laptops, and other digital devices, whenever and wherever they need it.”
Generally, help desk is used to refer to how companies help their users with any technology-related issues. Help desks can support customers in their use of a company’s apps, tech-driven products, and web sites. Internal-facing help desks support employees using technology as part of their jobs.
Help desk can refer to both the team within an organization that’s responsible for supporting users and the software that powers their support work. Depending on the size of the organization, your help desk could be one person with some software and a phone, or a small army of technicians, service agents, and software developers. One of the great things about modern help desk software is that helps small businesses, in particular, is that it enables as few as just one person behind the virtual desk to provide a small army’s worth of customer support.









              
                Help yourself to a shiny new help desk.
              















                        Is it help desk or helpdesk?
                    





	Your guess is as good as ours! Search the web and you’ll find it spelled both ways. That said, most often you’ll see “help desk” (two words), and not “helpdesk” (one word). So we’ll go with that: help desk.












                        Is a help desk a real desk or a virtual desk?
                    





Time for a quick quiz.
A help desk is:
   A. A brick-and-mortar location staffed by support experts who help customers with their issues.
   B. A virtual space dedicated to solving customer support issues.
   C. Either A or B, depending on your business need.
While the name help desk may conjure up images of a brick-and-mortar location staffed by people, a la Apple’s famous in-store “Genius Bars,” most companies today run virtual help desks, either instead of or alongside of physical desks. If you chose answer “C” above, congratulations: You aced the quick quiz!
Help desk software helps companies design their support sites and populate them with helpful content. Integrated workflows can connect customers with the right service agents to resolve their problems. Automations within the software can also answer simple queries with preset answers.
Support staff employees maintain the help desk and use it to communicate with customers via digital channels. Help desk systems can also record valuable user data employees can use to prioritize support requests, create helpful content for the site, and otherwise find new ways to serve their users.








              
                Ready to build your own virtual genius bar?
              















                        Do customers prefer self-service?
                    





Remember what we said at the top about today’s customers being large and in charge? That extends to how they ask for help. Consumers love self-service. Research shows that 90% of consumers now expect a brand or organization to offer a self-service customer support portal, and roughly three-quarters of consumers want the ability to solve product/service issues on their own.
A good help desk solution will include solid self-service offerings. For as much as everybody’s always on their phones these days, many people don’t actually like to talk on the phone. Whether your help desk is external- or internal-facing, users should be able to log service tickets, check the status of their cases, and modify or close them as needed, all without having to speak to a service rep. When an agent is required to resolve more complex issues, you can offer text chat and email-based help through a self-service portal.
Remember: Phone-based service, good. Making customers talk on their phones, not always so good.








              
                This is the self-help button. Go ahead, press it!
              















                        How does a help desk work?
                    





Modern help desk support strategies are two-fold, combining people and technology. Your online help desk is the go-to place for your customers and employees to get answers to commonly asked questions. They can also use the help desk to log service requests — tickets — for problems that aren’t easily resolved.
Your service teams are, of course, the key to offering great help desk support. From designing the help desk website and filling it with the right content, to helping customers in real-time, it’s the people that make customer support great. But the right help desk software can be a huge asset to any service organization, in terms of both helping customers find answers faster and helping your teams work more efficiently.

                        Help desks use tickets! What’s a ticket?
                    





The help desk on your website is usually the first place customers and employees go when they’re trying to solve a problem. Help desk software powers the site and directs customers to where they need to go. The software in turn helps employees organize, process, and resolve support issues through the use of support tickets.
What are help desk tickets? A ticket — call it a help desk ticket, support ticket, incident ticket, or just plain ticket — is a record of a support request. In the context of a help desk system, though, they become the keys to unlocking efficiency and customer satisfaction. Tickets are issued and recorded electronically whenever a request comes in. The system then gathers all of the support requests into one central spot where they can be organized, reviewed, prioritized, and routed either manually or via automated workflows.
Automated workflows are a help desk’s best friend. Workflows can answer common questions with preset responses, and route more challenging queries to the right agents, freeing staff from routine tasks so they can focus on more complex ones. Help desk software also makes it much easier to field and respond to questions across multiple channels, which can be a huge asset to smaller teams supporting customers across Facebook, Twitter, and other social media.
Seriously, have you ever been on social media? So many questions and witty comments out there! Couldn’t you use a little automation to make sure you’re replying to all the right posts?













                        What are the awesome side benefits of help desks?
                    





Help desks offer a huge side benefit beyond, you know, helping people. They’re great at collecting valuable customer data.
When customers or employees ask a question or search for an answer on your help desk site, the software keeps track of their queries. That data can then be shared across your entire organization, helping inform everything from service and support strategies to marketing campaigns and new product roadmaps.
Integrating your help desk services with CRM unlocks a host of features to help your business succeed, including mapping support cases to individual customer records, logging those tickets as cases, and using that data to help create more personalized experiences for your customers.
Automated logging and reporting of service activity ensures that each support ticket is worth its weight in actionable data. To that end, many help desk systems now offer analytics and customer satisfaction surveys (CSAT). Analytics tools crunch the numbers for you, turning mountains of data into insights you can actually understand. From intuitive, real-time alerts to visual presentation of key insights, help desk analytics can really pave the road from service to sales within your company.
Hot Tip Alert: Customer Service is one of the most under-utilized competitive advantages.
Guess what happens when unhappy customers feel like their complaints have really been heard? Believe it or not, many of them will become your biggest — and loudest — fans.
CSAT unlocks this advantage by asking customers to rate their service experience once their query has been resolved. Make sure your help desk system supports CSAT, and start out simple. Many businesses opt for a one question survey along the lines of, “How satisfied were you with the resolution we provided today?”









              
                See how much more a help desk can help you.
              















                        Why is a help desk so important (beyond the helping people part)?
                    





Everybody needs a little help sometimes. Even you. And us. 
Whether yours is a small business with a single, centralized desk, or a large enterprise with a multiple desks supporting different parts of the business, a help desk is a critical part of maintaining good customer relations and employee happiness. Help desks serve as the nerve center for customer support, and a smoothly running help desk can both increase customer satisfaction and supply the rest of your business with valuable insights on what users really think of your brand and products.









              
                Get yourself a help desk - it’s important!
              















                        How can help desk support unlock customer satisfaction?
                    





Quick Review:

A satisfied customer is a happy customer, and a customer happiness breeds customer loyalty.
Even the best products on the market require support, and responsive, user-friendly help desks are at the heart of customer satisfaction.

So, what’s a business to do? Answer questions! Satisfy customers! And do it quickly.
Answering questions quickly and accurately is a proven way to grow customer happiness. When customers know that you stand by your offerings — whether through support and service of existing products, or improving the quality of new product lines — they’re more likely to generate repeat business and recommend you to their friends and networks.
Internal help desks serve the same functions for your employees. When it comes to the IT services that keep your business humming, employees are your customers. Efficient, reliable, and user-friendly internal help desk support improves the daily quality of your staff’s work lives while also building long-term satisfaction amongst employees. That’s no small thing when it comes to retaining talent. 









              
                Unlock customer satisfaction? Yes, please!
              















                        Help desk support can drive internal efficiencies, too?
                    





Help desk support can also be a boon to efficiency across your entire organization. A great help desk makes things easier for your customers and employees, as we’ve discussed. But the other internal benefits can also be game-changing, starting with your support team and radiating out from there. Here’s a quick list:
1. Accountability
Good help desk software helps your support team prioritize and assign support requests, so every member of the team knows what to focus on, and accountability is built into your culture. 
2. Documentation
The system also records case histories, making it easy to differentiate between one-off issues and recurring problems that need deeper attention, or are easily resolved using a previous fix easily retrieved by anyone on your team.
3. Time Tracking*
Time tracking is another efficiency-boosting feature of modern help desk software. Keeping tabs on how long different issues take to resolve gives you a high-level view of where your IT support budget is being spent, which is helpful for planning and forecasting. Seeing how quickly each of your support agents and technicians typically solve different types of problems can also help you play to their strengths by routing incoming tickets according to who’s most efficient at particular types of support work. At year’s end, you can easily run reports to show how much time the help desk spent keeping your customers and employees moving forward. 
*Which leads to 4. Budgeting, 5. Forecasting, and 6 Reporting. Efficiencies, woot woot!













                        Are help desk jobs in demand?
                    





With all of the benefits that help desks can bring to businesses of all types and sizes, it comes as no surprise that skilled help desk staff is in demand. According to the Service Desk Institute, 36% of service desks planned to increase their staffing levels in 2018. The United States Bureau of Labor projects some 88,500 new support specialist jobs will be created between 2016-26. That’s a growth rate of 11%, which is well above the national average of 7% growth across all occupations tracked by the bureau.
Technology may make the world go round, but it’s talent that spells the difference between a business and a successful business. Your help desk is no different. In fact, the average service desk spends 68.5% of its budget on staffing costs and only 9.3% on technology, per MetricNet. From the people designing and implementing your support software to the agents who resolve service tickets, there are a number of key roles to be filled in any help desk team.








              
                Build a help desk and the workforce will beat a path to your door.
              















                        What kinds of jobs are there on a help desk? 
                    





Help desk jobs range from entry-level technical associates to executives in charge of budget, management, and strategy for multiple desks in enterprise environments. While there aren’t any hard and fast educational requirements for landing a help desk job, many employers look for a Bachelor’s Degree (BA/BS) or even Master of Business Administration (MBA) as a minimum benchmark for certain positions. Professional certifications on specific technologies, or knowledge and role-based certifications like those offered by the Help Desk Institute (HDI), may be sought after by recruiters and hiring managers, as well.
HDI’s list of knowledge and role-based certification classes is actually a great resource in and of itself for better understanding some common help desk job titles and descriptions. Common individual contributor-level help desk roles include:

Help Desk Specialist
Help Desk Technician
Customer Service Representative
Support Center Analyst
Desktop Support Technician
Technical Support Professional

Managerial positions at the help desk include:

Help Desk Manager
Support Center Team Lead
Desktop Support Manager
Support Center Director

Help desk jobs focused on customer support (external-facing) may fall under the umbrella of “Customer Support,” “Customer Experience,” or the like, instead of Help Desk. Small businesses often combine multiple help desk roles into a single position, owing to the “everybody wears multiple hats” nature of working at a smaller company.

","What is Help Desk Software? - Salesforce.comSkip to content                                 What is a Help Desk?                                                         Great customer support is essential to staying competitive, no matter what industry you’re in. Your company can have the best products, and lead the way in innovative business practices, but offering strong customer support is still a must.Let’s get one thing straight up front: Today’s customers are large and in charge. We live in a consumer-centric time, where customers have the power to instantly rate, review, and rave about your offerings. Between social media, e-commerce, and review sites, customers can talk to and about you anytime and anywhere, and there’s always somebody listening. Companies have to be ready to field support requests and other customer queries whenever and wherever they arise.This is where the help desk comes in.                                                                     It’s a desk where I get help. Right?                     Help desks aren’t actually desks. Sometimes help desk means the people who work at the help desk, but sometimes it means the software those people use. And it only refers to helping people with technical problems. At least in our context. Confused yet? Totally understandable. So let’s break this down.Help desk is defined as a tool or service for supporting computer users. We know what you’re thinking, your customers use phones, not s. Fair enough. Let’s update that to say, “supporting people using phones, laptops, and other digital devices, whenever and wherever they need it.”Generally, help desk is used to refer to how companies help their users with any technology-related issues. Help desks can support customers in their use of a company’s apps, tech-driven products, and web sites. Internal-facing help desks support employees using technology as part of their jobs.Help desk can refer to both the team within an organization that’s responsible for supporting users and the software that powers their support work. Depending on the size of the organization, your help desk could be one person with some software and a phone, or a small army of technicians, service agents, and software developers. One of the great things about modern help desk software is that helps small businesses, in particular, is that it enables as few as just one person behind the virtual desk to provide a small army’s worth of customer support.                              Help yourself to a shiny new help desk.                                      Is it help desk or helpdesk?                    	Your guess is as good as ours! Search the web and you’ll find it spelled both ways. That said, most often you’ll see “help desk” (two words), and not “helpdesk” (one word). So we’ll go with that: help desk.                        Is a help desk a real desk or a virtual desk?                    Time for a quick quiz.A help desk is:   A. A brick-and-mortar location staffed by support experts who help customers with their issues.   B. A virtual space dedicated to solving customer support issues.   C. Either A or B, depending on your business need.While the name help desk may conjure up images of a brick-and-mortar location staffed by people, a la Apple’s famous in-store “Genius Bars,” most companies today run virtual help desks, either instead of or alongside of physical desks. If you chose answer “C” above, congratulations: You aced the quick quiz!Help desk software helps companies design their support sites and populate them with helpful content. Integrated workflows can connect customers with the right service agents to resolve their problems. Automations within the software can also answer simple queries with preset answers.Support staff employees maintain the help desk and use it to communicate with customers via digital channels. Help desk systems can also record valuable user data employees can use to prioritize support requests, create helpful content for the site, and otherwise find new ways to serve their users.                              Ready to build your own virtual genius bar?                                      Do customers prefer self-service?                    Remember what we said at the top about today’s customers being large and in charge? That extends to how they ask for help. Consumers love self-service. Research shows that 90% of consumers now expect a brand or organization to offer a self-service customer support portal, and roughly three-quarters of consumers want the ability to solve product/service issues on their own.A good help desk solution will include solid self-service offerings. For as much as everybody’s always on their phones these days, many people don’t actually like to talk on the phone. Whether your help desk is external- or internal-facing, users should be able to log service tickets, check the status of their cases, and modify or close them as needed, all without having to speak to a service rep. When an agent is required to resolve more complex issues, you can offer text chat and email-based help through a self-service portal.Remember: Phone-based service, good. Making customers talk on their phones, not always so good.                              This is the self-help button. Go ahead, press it!                                      How does a help desk work?                    Modern help desk support strategies are two-fold, combining people and technology. Your online help desk is the go-to place for your customers and employees to get answers to commonly asked questions. They can also use the help desk to log service requests — tickets — for problems that aren’t easily resolved.Your service teams are, of course, the key to offering great help desk support. From designing the help desk website and filling it with the right content, to helping customers in real-time, it’s the people that make customer support great. But the right help desk software can be a huge asset to any service organization, in terms of both helping customers find answers faster and helping your teams work more efficiently.                              Learn more about how help desks can benefit your entire organization.                                      Help desks use tickets! What’s a ticket?                    The help desk on your website is usually the first place customers and employees go when they’re trying to solve a problem. Help desk software powers the site and directs customers to where they need to go. The software in turn helps employees organize, process, and resolve support issues through the use of support tickets.What are help desk tickets? A ticket — call it a help desk ticket, support ticket, incident ticket, or just plain ticket — is a record of a support request. In the context of a help desk system, though, they become the keys to unlocking efficiency and customer satisfaction. Tickets are issued and recorded electronically whenever a request comes in. The system then gathers all of the support requests into one central spot where they can be organized, reviewed, prioritized, and routed either manually or via automated workflows.Automated workflows are a help desk’s best friend. Workflows can answer common questions with preset responses, and route more challenging queries to the right agents, freeing staff from routine tasks so they can focus on more complex ones. Help desk software also makes it much easier to field and respond to questions across multiple channels, which can be a huge asset to smaller teams supporting customers across Facebook, Twitter, and other social media.Seriously, have you ever been on social media? So many questions and witty comments out there! Couldn’t you use a little automation to make sure you’re replying to all the right posts?                        What are the awesome side benefits of help desks?                    Help desks offer a huge side benefit beyond, you know, helping people. They’re great at collecting valuable customer data.When customers or employees ask a question or search for an answer on your help desk site, the software keeps track of their queries. That data can then be shared across your entire organization, helping inform everything from service and support strategies to marketing campaigns and new product roadmaps.Integrating your help desk services with  unlocks a host of features to help your business succeed, including mapping support cases to individual customer records, logging those tickets as cases, and using that data to help create more personalized experiences for your customers.Automated logging and reporting of service activity ensures that each support ticket is worth its weight in actionable data. To that end, many help desk systems now offer analytics and customer satisfaction surveys (). Analytics tools crunch the numbers for you, turning mountains of data into insights you can actually understand. From intuitive, real-time alerts to visual presentation of key insights, help desk analytics can really pave the road from service to sales within your company.Hot Tip Alert: Customer Service is one of the most under-utilized competitive advantages.Guess what happens when unhappy customers feel like their complaints have really been heard? Believe it or not, many of them will become your biggest — and loudest — fans. unlocks this advantage by asking customers to rate their service experience once their query has been resolved. Make sure your help desk system supports , and start out simple. Many businesses opt for a one question survey along the lines of, “How satisfied were you with the resolution we provided today?”                              See how much more a help desk can help you.                                      Why is a help desk so important (beyond the helping people part)?                    Everybody needs a little help sometimes. Even you. And us. Whether yours is a small business with a single, centralized desk, or a large enterprise with a multiple desks supporting different parts of the business, a help desk is a critical part of maintaining good customer relations and employee happiness. Help desks serve as the nerve center for customer support, and a smoothly running help desk can both increase customer satisfaction and supply the rest of your business with valuable insights on what users really think of your brand and products.                              Get yourself a help desk - it’s important!                                      How can help desk support unlock customer satisfaction?                    Quick Review:A satisfied customer is a happy customer, and a customer happiness breeds customer loyalty.Even the best products on the market require support, and responsive, user-friendly help desks are at the heart of customer satisfaction.So, what’s a business to do? Answer questions! Satisfy customers! And do it quickly.Answering questions quickly and accurately is a proven way to grow customer happiness. When customers know that you stand by your offerings — whether through support and service of existing products, or improving the quality of new product lines — they’re more likely to generate repeat business and recommend you to their friends and networks.Internal help desks serve the same functions for your employees. When it comes to the  services that keep your business humming, employees are your customers. Efficient, reliable, and user-friendly internal help desk support improves the daily quality of your staff’s work lives while also building long-term satisfaction amongst employees. That’s no small thing when it comes to retaining talent.                               Unlock customer satisfaction? Yes, please!                                      Help desk support can drive internal efficiencies, too?                    Help desk support can also be a boon to efficiency across your entire organization. A great help desk makes things easier for your customers and employees, as we’ve discussed. But the other internal benefits can also be game-changing, starting with your support team and radiating out from there. Here’s a quick list:1. AccountabilityGood help desk software helps your support team prioritize and assign support requests, so every member of the team knows what to focus on, and accountability is built into your culture. 2. DocumentationThe system also records case histories, making it easy to differentiate between one-off issues and recurring problems that need deeper attention, or are easily resolved using a previous fix easily retrieved by anyone on your team.3. Time Tracking*Time tracking is another efficiency-boosting feature of modern help desk software. Keeping tabs on how long different issues take to resolve gives you a high-level view of where your  support budget is being spent, which is helpful for planning and forecasting. Seeing how quickly each of your support agents and technicians typically solve different types of problems can also help you play to their strengths by routing incoming tickets according to who’s most efficient at particular types of support work. At year’s end, you can easily run reports to show how much time the help desk spent keeping your customers and employees moving forward. *Which leads to 4. Budgeting, 5. Forecasting, and 6 Reporting. Efficiencies, woot woot!                        Are help desk jobs in demand?                    With all of the benefits that help desks can bring to businesses of all types and sizes, it comes as no surprise that skilled help desk staff is in demand. According to the Service Desk Institute, 36% of service desks planned to increase their staffing levels in 2018. The United States Bureau of Labor projects some 88,500 new support specialist jobs will be created between 2016-26. That’s a growth rate of 11%, which is well above the national average of 7% growth across all occupations tracked by the bureau.Technology may make the world go round, but it’s talent that spells the difference between a business and a successful business. Your help desk is no different. In fact, the average service desk spends 68.5% of its budget on staffing costs and only 9.3% on technology, per MetricNet. From the people designing and implementing your support software to the agents who resolve service tickets, there are a number of key roles to be filled in any help desk team.                              Build a help desk and the workforce will beat a path to your door.                                      What kinds of jobs are there on a help desk?                     Help desk jobs range from entry-level technical associates to executives in charge of budget, management, and strategy for multiple desks in enterprise environments. While there aren’t any hard and fast educational requirements for landing a help desk job, many employers look for a Bachelor’s Degree (/) or even Master of Business Administration () as a minimum benchmark for certain positions. Professional certifications on specific technologies, or knowledge and role-based certifications like those offered by the Help Desk Institute (), may be sought after by recruiters and hiring managers, as well.’s list of knowledge and role-based certification classes is actually a great resource in and of itself for better understanding some common help desk job titles and descriptions. Common individual contributor-level help desk roles include:Help Desk SpecialistHelp Desk TechnicianCustomer Service RepresentativeSupport Center AnalystDesktop Support TechnicianTechnical Support ProfessionalManagerial positions at the help desk include:Help Desk ManagerSupport Center Team LeadDesktop Support ManagerSupport Center DirectorHelp desk jobs focused on customer support (external-facing) may fall under the umbrella of “Customer Support,” “Customer Experience,” or the like, instead of Help Desk. Small businesses often combine multiple help desk roles into a single position, owing to the “everybody wears multiple hats” nature of working at a smaller company.                               See how easy it is to deliver awesome customer support.

Help desks serve as the nerve center for customer support, and a smoothly running help desk can both increase customer satisfaction and supply the rest of your business with valuable insights on what users really think of your brand and products. Quick Review:A satisfied customer is a happy customer, and a customer happiness breeds customer loyalty.Even the best products on the market require support, and responsive, user-friendly help desks are at the heart of customer satisfaction.So, what’s a business to do? When customers know that you stand by your offerings — whether through support and service of existing products, or improving the quality of new product lines — they’re more likely to generate repeat business and recommend you to their friends and networks.Internal help desks serve the same functions for your employees. Efficient, reliable, and user-friendly internal help desk support improves the daily quality of your staff’s work lives while also building long-term satisfaction amongst employees. A great help desk makes things easier for your customers and employees, as we’ve discussed. AccountabilityGood help desk software helps your support team prioritize and assign support requests, so every member of the team knows what to focus on, and accountability is built into your culture. Keeping tabs on how long different issues take to resolve gives you a high-level view of where your  support budget is being spent, which is helpful for planning and forecasting. At year’s end, you can easily run reports to show how much time the help desk spent keeping your customers and employees moving forward. With all of the benefits that help desks can bring to businesses of all types and sizes, it comes as no surprise that skilled help desk staff is in demand. From the people designing and implementing your support software to the agents who resolve service tickets, there are a number of key roles to be filled in any help desk team. Help desk jobs range from entry-level technical associates to executives in charge of budget, management, and strategy for multiple desks in enterprise environments. While there aren’t any hard and fast educational requirements for landing a help desk job, many employers look for a Bachelor’s Degree (/) or even Master of Business Administration () as a minimum benchmark for certain positions. Professional certifications on specific technologies, or knowledge and role-based certifications like those offered by the Help Desk Institute (), may be sought after by recruiters and hiring managers, as well.’s list of knowledge and role-based certification classes is actually a great resource in and of itself for better understanding some common help desk job titles and descriptions. Common individual contributor-level help desk roles include:Help Desk SpecialistHelp Desk TechnicianCustomer Service RepresentativeSupport Center AnalystDesktop Support TechnicianTechnical Support ProfessionalManagerial positions at the help desk include:Help Desk ManagerSupport Center Team LeadDesktop Support ManagerSupport Center DirectorHelp desk jobs focused on customer support (external-facing) may fall under the umbrella of “Customer Support,” “Customer Experience,” or the like, instead of Help Desk. Small businesses often combine multiple help desk roles into a single position, owing to the “everybody wears multiple hats” nature of working at a smaller company. Salesforce Essentials is a great way for small and medium size businesses (s) to build out a full-featured help desk with minimal resources or upfront investment. And the integrated  and knowledge base functionality make it easy to set up a branded self-service site to help customers solve issues on their own.With Essentials, you get all the ease of use, security, and scalability of the Salesforce platform.

                Salesforce Reviews: What to Look For and Why Thousands Choose Salesforce CRM 
            
            
            
            
        



Businesses of all sizes, from startups and small businesses to medium-sized organizations and leading international corporations, know what the right CRM (customer relationship management) can do to maximize and grow your customer-focused operations. CRM and contact management are the proven way to increase productivity and drive results. 
But how do you choose the right CRM for your organization? A quick glance at CRM software review sites show why Salesforce is the #1 CRM for businesses of all sizes.





            
                Salesforce is the Market Leader in CRM. 
            
            
            
            
        



Industry analysts agree: Salesforce is the undisputed CRM market leader. Salesforce was ranked the #1 CRM in for the seventh consecutive year in 2020, growing its overall market share position and increasing its revenue more than any other CRM vendor. IDC’s Worldwide Semiannual Software Tracker, October 2020 also named Salesforce the market share leader in sales, customer service, marketing, model-driven application platforms and enterprise community applications.
Salesforce brings companies and customers together. The near-endless customization, extendability, and scalability of the Salesforce platform make it a great tool for businesses of all sizes. That said, this blog post is a great primer on specific ways Salesforce brings companies and customers together across sales, marketing, service, and all the rest of a company’s departments. 
With product offerings tailored to entrepreneurs, small and medium size businesses (SMBs), and larger organizations, Salesforce technology is built to support the way you work now, and to scale as your business grows. Salesforce reviews from customers across all industries and business sizes are a great place to learn first-hand what our solutions can do.





            
                What to look for in Salesforce reviews. 
            
            
            
            
        



	As you research CRM solutions for your business, keep these questions in mind. They represent common concerns customers of all sizes use to evaluate Salesforce solutions against the competition:





            
                Is Salesforce safe? 
            
            
            
            
        



	When it comes to trusting your business data to the hands of a software or services provider, safety should be priority number one. Trust is Salesforce’s #1 value, and ensuring the safety of customer data is one of the biggest ways we earn that trust. Look for mentions of data security and safety when browsing Salesforce reviews.





            
                What are the advantages of Salesforce? 
            
            
            
            
        



	What are the Salesforce Advantages? We put a lot of value in these five: innovation, platform, productivity, mobility, and community. As you research Salesforce reviews, ask yourself if the competition can compete across all five areas.





            
                How does Salesforce stack up to the competition? 
            
            
            
            
        



	Comparison shopping is a great way to see how different CRM solutions compare directly to one another in terms of features, benefits, and deficiencies. We did a little comparison shopping of our own to see how Salesforce stacks up to the competition — you can use our overview as a guide when doing your own research. In a nutshell, scalability, customizations, reporting and analytics, community, and trust are key areas where we think Salesforce really rises above our competitors.

“The one thing that Salesforce does that I was not expecting was to keep all of how I communicate and all of my files in one place,” she said. “If I write an email or save a contract, Essentials automatically pulls it into the system. So I have saved a great bit of time from not having to do that again.”

        - Gwendolyn Houston-Jack, Owner, G-Photography

        - Mazi Rasulnia, President and CEO, Pack Health

        - Jo Mouseelli, Co-Founder, President & CEO, Xtreme Lashes

        - Brian MacDonald, Chief Technology Officer, Paws En Route
        
        
    



“As we've made our transition to Salesforce we're able to work so much more cohesively as a team. We see the actual impact that this tool has had, as opposed to us just trying to, like, hack it and make it on our own.”

        - Bennett Bennett, Head of Customer Success and Support, Mashgin
        
        
    



“We needed a single cloud-based platform that could store all our data, run apps for every department, and deliver value to our clients. After a long, very detailed search, we found Salesforce provided all that, and more.”

        - Ali Moshfeghian, COO, Xtreme Lashes

“We rolled out CarMax Curbside to the whole country — to thousands of associates and all our customers — in less than three weeks. All this was possible because of the Salesforce Customer 360’s ability to scale and allow us to move at great speed.”

        - Shamim Mohammad, Chief Information and Technology Officer, CarMax
        
        
    



“Real digital transformation can only happen when you have the proper alignment of your people and processes with your ERP. And there is no better way to make that happen than to have everything in one native platform.”

        - Josh Batz, Chief Technology Officer, Fike Corp
        
        
    



“We’re even more conscious about looking at insights on a constant basis and pivoting our strategies as needed,” said Ekta. “Our digital transformation started with Salesforce and the hard work and investments are paying off.”

        - Ekta Chopra, Chief Digital Officer, ELF Cosmetics

        - Dr. Astrid Fontaine, Board Member for People, Digitalization and IT, Bentley Motors
        
        
    



“Online, just by nature, it is a little bit cold, a bit impersonal. Thanks to Salesforce, we were able to build customer journeys — to provide our individual customers with an experience that was as close as possible to their expectations and desires.”

        - Francesca Picchiò, Digital & CRM Program Manager, Brunello Cucinelli.
        
        
    



“There is something unique about the relationship we have with Salesforce. Because Salesforce immediately grasped the specificity of our project, of what we wanted to do. They also understood our need to break away from the mainstream, to think outside the box.”

        - Francesca Picchiò, Digital & CRM Program Manager, Brunello Cucinelli.

There’s a good reason why CarMax is the largest retailer of used vehicles in the United States: because of the trust it has created with its customers.
“Trust is at the core of why CarMax exists,” said Shamim Mohammad, the company’s Chief Information and Technology Officer. “We brought integrity and transparency into the car buying process — and we made the process very simple and easy.”
Having first disrupted the automotive retail sector when it launched in 1993, CarMax disrupted the industry for a second time by launching a true omni-channel experience that empowers customers to buy a car on their terms: online, in-store, and a seamless integration of both. Here’s how the company used Salesforce to create that experience, delight customers in new and innovative ways, and reimagine car buying.



 
    








“By delivering an omni-channel experience, we’re putting our customers in the driver’s seat. They now have the flexibility to interact and transact with us however they want. They can begin their journey online and progress as much or as little as they like to online.”

Step 1: Create an omni-channel experience.
Step 2: Reimagine the in-person customer experience.
Step 3: Enable great customer experiences through great employee experiences.
Step 4: Find a new gear to accelerate change.











In this video [1:55], discover how CarMax is revolutionizing the car buying experience with a seamless combination of online and in-store buying through Customer 360. Skip to 0:41 to hear the story of how CarMax personalized the experience for a new mom.





            
                1. Create an omni-channel experience. 
            
            
            
            
        



Anticipating its customers would want more control of the car-buying journey, the company set about creating a human-centered, omni-channel experience that enabled customers to interact seamlessly online and with their stores, and truly buy a car on their terms.
The car buying process isn't completely linear, and a single customer may interact with multiple associates during their unique journey, from remote support specialists to in-store associates. So, CarMax worked with Salesforce to create a centralized view of the customer to provide a seamless experience across all touchpoints.
As Shamim said, “It gives us the single source of truth. With a 360-degree view, we know exactly where a customer is on their car-shopping journey. Whether it’s our sales, support, or delivery people, they can give the customer an outstanding experience.”
The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) to personalize customer experiences across channels, providing product recommendations for customers and time-saving “next best actions” for associates. It also uses AI to automatically classify and route incoming customer SMS messages, increasing associates’ productivity and customer satisfaction.
In addition, the company launched multiple contact centers to provide remote concierge support that helps customers via phone, text, and digital channels while they’re shopping online.

                2. Reimagine the in-person customer experience. 
            
            
            
            
        



Before 2020, CarMax was already well underway with its ambitious digital transformation. Then the pandemic hit.
With its strong, digital foundation in place, the company was able to quickly pivot, accelerating the launch of its omni-channel experience to the rest of the country and rolling out CarMax curbside delivery within three weeks.

                to roll out CarMax Curbside 
            
            
            
            
        









CarMax Curbside is a new contactless way for customers to test drive and buy a new car with adherence to social-distancing practices. CarMax also offers a home delivery option for most customers.
Associates can concentrate on providing outstanding onsite customer service experiences, thanks to appointment scheduling, guided checklists, and other workflows.
“Now, when you book an appointment for a test drive online, it triggers a workflow that ensures the car is checked, clean, comfortable, and ready for you to drive,” said Permjit Ghotra, AVP, Head of Customer Shopping and Transactions Technology at CarMax.
The buying experience is just as seamless. Customers can save time by completing most of the process online in advance, such as getting preapproval for financing.



 
    


“We rolled out CarMax Curbside to the whole country — to thousands of associates and all our customers — in less than three weeks. All this was possible because of the Salesforce Customer 360’s ability to scale and allow us to move at great speed.”

        Shamim Mohammad

                Chief Information and Technology Officer 
            
        


















In this short video [0:58], see how CarMax enabled curbside delivery during the pandemic so customers could touch, feel, and drive their car before purchasing.





            
                3. Enable great customer experiences through great employee experiences. 
            
            
            
            
        



One important reason for CarMax’s success is that it puts both customers and employees at the center of every decision.
CarMax redesigned its customer experiences at a fundamental level with intentional relationship design. This involved listening to customers and using design thinking and other tools to empathetically, but deliberately, evolve its relationships with customers.
Custom apps also enhance experiences for both employees and customers. The company’s coders benefit from a modern agile developer experience and use prebuilt partner solutions to accelerate the time-to-market for their apps. On the front end, CarMax’s associates have the tools and information they need to delight customers.



 
    


“For example, our delivery team learned that a customer had a new baby, so they included a gift of toys with the car delivery. It was a nice surprise for the new mom.”

        Shamim Mohammad
        
         |
            
                Chief Information and Technology Officer 
            
        


















In this short video [0:59], you’ll see how Customer 360 played a crucial role in deploying CarMax’s curbside delivery option in less than three weeks through a scalable platform.





            
                4. Find a new gear to accelerate change. 
            
            
            
            
        



Since the start of the pandemic, CarMax has “found a new gear,” according to Bryan Ennis, Vice President, Customer Experience Centers and Customer Relations. “We’re able to move and innovate faster than ever before,” he said.
Customer-facing associates play a vital role, with some included in the company’s product teams. This ensures development initiatives address user pain points from the beginning, and meaningful testing and training starts early. As a result, it now takes days, not months, to train staff when a new capability or app is rolled out.
Ultimately, it’s this combination of people, culture, and technology that enables this rapid change and allows CarMax to continue to reimagine the future of car buying.""



 
    


“CarMax has always had an amazing culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. But lately, we've brought in a lot of digital-native characteristics, so we operate like a digital technology company.”

Here’s how the company used Salesforce to create that experience, delight customers in new and innovative ways, and reimagine car buying.     “By delivering an omni-channel experience, we’re putting our customers in the driver’s seat. They now have the flexibility to interact and transact with us however they want. They can begin their journey online and progress as much or as little as they like to online.”        Shamim Mohammad                 |                            Chief Information and Technology Officer                                                 Contents                                                         Step 1: Create an omni-channel experience.Step 2: Reimagine the in-person customer experience.Step 3: Enable great customer experiences through great employee experiences.Step 4: Find a new gear to accelerate change.In this video [1:55], discover how CarMax is revolutionizing the car buying experience with a seamless combination of online and in-store buying through Customer 360. Skip to 0:41 to hear the story of how CarMax personalized the experience for a new mom.                            1. Create an omni-channel experience.                                                         Anticipating its customers would want more control of the car-buying journey, the company set about creating a human-centered, omni-channel experience that enabled customers to interact seamlessly online and with their stores, and truly buy a car on their terms.The car buying process isn't completely linear, and a single customer may interact with multiple associates during their unique journey, from remote support specialists to in-store associates. So, CarMax worked with Salesforce to create a centralized view of the customer to provide a seamless experience across all touchpoints.As Shamim said, “It gives us the single source of truth. With a 360-degree view, we know exactly where a customer is on their car-shopping journey. Whether it’s our sales, support, or delivery people, they can give the customer an outstanding experience.”The company uses artificial intelligence () to personalize customer experiences across channels, providing product recommendations for customers and time-saving “next best actions” for associates. It also uses  to automatically classify and route incoming customer  messages, increasing associates’ productivity and customer satisfaction.In addition, the company launched multiple contact centers to provide remote concierge support that helps customers via phone, text, and digital channels while they’re shopping online.Watch this short video [0:50] to discover how CarMax used Service Cloud to provide associates with a single source of truth for insight into every customer interaction.

Before 2020, CarMax was already well underway with its ambitious digital transformation. Then the pandemic hit.With its strong, digital foundation in place, the company was able to quickly pivot, accelerating the launch of its omni-channel experience to the rest of the country and rolling out CarMax curbside delivery within three weeks.                                 to roll out CarMax Curbside                                                                                     to roll out CarMax Curbside                                                         CarMax Curbside is a new contactless way for customers to test drive and buy a new car with adherence to social-distancing practices. CarMax also offers a home delivery option for most customers.Associates can concentrate on providing outstanding onsite customer service experiences, thanks to appointment scheduling, guided checklists, and other workflows.“Now, when you book an appointment for a test drive online, it triggers a workflow that ensures the car is checked, clean, comfortable, and ready for you to drive,” said Permjit Ghotra, , Head of Customer Shopping and Transactions Technology at CarMax.The buying experience is just as seamless. Customers can save time by completing most of the process online in advance, such as getting preapproval for financing.     “We rolled out CarMax Curbside to the whole country — to thousands of associates and all our customers — in less than three weeks. All this was possible because of the Salesforce Customer 360’s ability to scale and allow us to move at great speed.”        Shamim Mohammad                 |                            Chief Information and Technology Officer                     In this short video [0:58], see how CarMax enabled curbside delivery during the pandemic so customers could touch, feel, and drive their car before purchasing.                            3. Enable great customer experiences through great employee experiences.                                                         One important reason for CarMax’s success is that it puts both customers and employees at the center of every decision.CarMax redesigned its customer experiences at a fundamental level with intentional relationship design. This involved listening to customers and using design thinking and other tools to empathetically, but deliberately, evolve its relationships with customers.Custom apps also enhance experiences for both employees and customers. The company’s coders benefit from a modern agile developer experience and use prebuilt partner solutions to accelerate the time-to-market for their apps. On the front end, CarMax’s associates have the tools and information they need to delight customers.     “For example, our delivery team learned that a customer had a new baby, so they included a gift of toys with the car delivery. It was a nice surprise for the new mom.”        Shamim Mohammad                 |                            Chief Information and Technology Officer                     In this short video [0:59], you’ll see how Customer 360 played a crucial role in deploying CarMax’s curbside delivery option in less than three weeks through a scalable platform.                            4. Find a new gear to accelerate change.                                                         Since the start of the pandemic, CarMax has “found a new gear,” according to Bryan Ennis, Vice President, Customer Experience Centers and Customer Relations. “We’re able to move and innovate faster than ever before,” he said.Customer-facing associates play a vital role, with some included in the company’s product teams. This ensures development initiatives address user pain points from the beginning, and meaningful testing and training starts early. As a result, it now takes days, not months, to train staff when a new capability or app is rolled out.Ultimately, it’s this combination of people, culture, and technology that enables this rapid change and allows CarMax to continue to reimagine the future of car buying.""     “CarMax has always had an amazing culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. But lately, we've brought in a lot of digital-native characteristics, so we operate like a digital technology company.”        Shamim Mohammad                 |                            Chief Information and Technology Officer                                                      More Resources                                                              The Fastest Route to Field Service Success                            article                                                                                     The Fastest Route to Field Service Success                                                                                     The Fastest Route to Field Service Success                                                         The Fastest Route to Field Service SuccessYour Guide to Mobile Workforce Engagement                            Guide                                                                                     Your Guide to Mobile Workforce Engagement                                                                                     Your Guide to Mobile Workforce Engagement                                                         Your Guide to Mobile Workforce EngagementHow Bentley Motors Is Reimagining Its Customer Experience for the Next 100 Years                            Customer Story                                                                                     How Bentley Motors Is Reimagning Its Customer Experience for the Next 100 Years                                                                                     How Bentley Motors Is Reimagning Its Customer Experience for the Next 100 Years                                                         How Bentley Motors Is Reimagining Its Customer Experience for the Next 100 Years                                      Get timely updates and fresh ideas delivered to your inbox.

                Learn how Sonos adapted to customer needs during the pandemic with one integrated platform. 
            
            
            
            
        



At Sonos, premium experiences are everything. As the inventor of multi-room wireless home audio, Sonos innovation helps the world listen better by giving people access to the content they love and allowing them to control it however and wherever they choose.
But when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down brick-and-mortar retailers across the country, Sonos lost its traditional path to consumers. Immediately, Sonos had to find a way to bring the power of the in-store experience online, doubling down on digital-first revenue and ecommerce.
Since then, the company has been able to continue building customer relationships despite the unexpected shift and restrictions on in-person distribution channels. By directly interacting with customers across commerce, service, and marketing, Sonos was able to increase its direct-to-consumer (D2C) share of the business — all from one integrated platform.
Patrick Spence, CEO at Sonos, has been at the company for more than 12 years, applying his expertise in hardware and software technology to help listeners design the soundtrack of their lives. Because of the work he and his team had done upfront to build a connected platform, Sonos was able to quickly pivot to D2C experiences when it mattered most.
Let’s take a look at how Patrick and the team at Sonos are using Salesforce Customer 360 to change how they grow their relationships with customers in ways that meet their evolving needs.

In this video (2:24), hear Sonos CEO Patrick Spence describe how the company pivoted to (and thrived with) direct-to-consumer operations almost overnight despite having a remote customer service team.
































 
    





 
    


 
    











            
                1. Connect with shoppers anytime, anywhere. 
            
            
            
            
        



Prior to the pandemic, Sonos was already focused on improving D2C ecommerce sales through its website. But an unprecedented influx of ecommerce during quarantining (and little time to prepare) forced the company to accelerate its plans. With no brick-and-mortar retailer partners open to sell Sonos products during the early days of the pandemic, the company turned to its website to connect with customers directly.

Because Sonos already had centralized data and a 360-degree view of customers in place, the company was able to address the flood of B2C transactions with seamless, connected digital experiences across every touchpoint, no matter which department consumers interacted with. And by scaling both digital commerce and marketing, Sonos was able to message and advise customers of changes or delays in fulfillment directly in shopping carts to set the right expectations with delivery estimates. The result was an 84% increase in ecommerce growth year over year.

	In addition to its B2C commerce presence, Sonos also manages a digital B2B storefront for small and midsize dealers. But like consumers, business customers often have questions too. To continue managing global dealer and installer relationships with seamless service, Sonos set up a B2B community that houses everything from knowledge articles to podcasts to act as the main source of information for business customers.

                2. Scale service to meet changing customer needs. 
            
            
            
            
        



Alongside dramatic increases in D2C sales, Sonos also saw an increase in service requests. With a digital service strategy and single source of truth already in place, Sonos could scale to meet these increased requests by augmenting agents’ productivity with AI and automated tools to resolve customer needs. For customers who prefer to speak with a live person for support, Sonos adopted a voice tool to deliver the same level of personalization and intelligence by phone, resulting in 10% faster call resolution. And with a convenient user community of knowledge articles, customers could also use self-service for quicker answers.
“The customer doesn’t think about just needing service. They think about their entire experience with Sonos. So why wouldn’t we?” said Ruth Sleeter, CIO, Sonos.








Service Cloud equips teams with an omni-channel console, built-in productivity tools, automation, AI, and a unified view of every case detail and customer interaction.

Chatbots also allowed Sonos to address more customer needs, while providing an interactive experience. And because the chatbots are connected to CRM, they can even help customers with requests like open case lookup or order status, resulting in a 40%+ deflection rate in case volume.
Using a single view of each customer’s case and order history, agents can deliver more personalized and efficient service, saving 5 hours per week.
Sonos is also wall-to-wall on Slack with several automated workflows, making it easy to operate as a cohesive unit despite working remotely across distributed teams. Teams can swarm on a case alongside service data to make informed decisions that result in seamless service experiences.
Third party service agents can join the conversation too. Slack Connect allows Sonos to include them using shared channels — without requiring intense guest account management.
And customers benefit from helpful, engaging experiences that they want to share with friends and family. Amidst the pandemic, Sonos was able to achieve its 16th year of revenue growth.

To sell directly to consumers, communicating with them one-on-one is critical. But Sonos is not interested in just creating one-time customers. Data-first digital marketing allows Sonos to create personalized customer journeys based on login patterns, shopping cart abandonment behavior, and other usage data to build loyalty that results in repeat purchases.
At the start of the pandemic when the supply chain was heavily impacted, Sonos was able to quickly update its website to accurately reflect product availability and lead times. And with behavioral triggers in place for user emails captured through the site, Sonos has been able to personalize and automate email notifications when products that the customer is interested in are back in stock or have dropped in price.
In addition to messaging customers directly in carts, Sonos also set up retargeting efforts, creating multiple ad campaigns on owned and paid channels to redirect consumers from competitor search results.

	Like all other businesses, Sonos could not have anticipated the massive influx of D2C sales it received during the pandemic. But having one shared view of customer data that increased collaboration and alignment among its teams was the difference between surviving and thriving. With a single view of the customer, Sonos has continued to build a customer- and employee-centric business, unlocking new opportunities and building relationships like never before.

At Sonos, premium experiences are everything. As the inventor of multi-room wireless home audio, Sonos innovation helps the world listen better by giving people access to the content they love and allowing them to control it however and wherever they choose.But when the -19 pandemic shut down brick-and-mortar retailers across the country, Sonos lost its traditional path to consumers. Immediately, Sonos had to find a way to bring the power of the in-store experience online, doubling down on digital-first revenue and ecommerce.Since then, the company has been able to continue building customer relationships despite the unexpected shift and restrictions on in-person distribution channels. By directly interacting with customers across commerce, service, and marketing, Sonos was able to increase its direct-to-consumer (D2C) share of the business — all from one integrated platform.Patrick Spence,  at Sonos, has been at the company for more than 12 years, applying his expertise in hardware and software technology to help listeners design the soundtrack of their lives. Because of the work he and his team had done upfront to build a connected platform, Sonos was able to quickly pivot to D2C experiences when it mattered most.Let’s take a look at how Patrick and the team at Sonos are using Salesforce Customer 360 to change how they grow their relationships with customers in ways that meet their evolving needs.                                 Related Content                                                         Inside the Fourth Edition of the “State of Service” Report                            Article                                                                                     Inside the Fourth Edition of the “State of Service” report                                                         Inside the Fourth Edition of the “State of Service” ReportDirect to Consumer (D2C)                            Guide                                                                                     Direct to Consumer (D2C) Guide                                                         Direct to Consumer (D2C)The Transformation Playbook                            Guide                                                                                     The Customer 360 Playbook                                                         The Transformation Playbook                                      “There's a time in a customer's journey where they might run into an issue or a problem, and that is a defining moment where you can either rise to the occasion and help them or not.

In this video (2:24), hear Sonos  Patrick Spence describe how the company pivoted to (and thrived with) direct-to-consumer operations almost overnight despite having a remote customer service team.                                           1. Connect with shoppers anytime, anywhere.                                                         Prior to the pandemic, Sonos was already focused on improving D2C ecommerce sales through its website. But an unprecedented influx of ecommerce during quarantining (and little time to prepare) forced the company to accelerate its plans. With no brick-and-mortar retailer partners open to sell Sonos products during the early days of the pandemic, the company turned to its website to connect with customers directly.Because Sonos already had centralized data and a 360-degree view of customers in place, the company was able to address the flood of B2C transactions with seamless, connected digital experiences across every touchpoint, no matter which department consumers interacted with. And by scaling both digital commerce and marketing, Sonos was able to message and advise customers of changes or delays in fulfillment directly in shopping carts to set the right expectations with delivery estimates. The result was an 84% increase in ecommerce growth year over year.                                 Year-over-year ecommerce growth                                                         	In addition to its B2C commerce presence, Sonos also manages a digital B2B storefront for small and midsize dealers. But like consumers, business customers often have questions too. To continue managing global dealer and installer relationships with seamless service, Sonos set up a B2B community that houses everything from knowledge articles to podcasts to act as the main source of information for business customers.                                   Learn more about Commerce Cloud                                                 Learn more about Experience Cloud                                          2. Scale service to meet changing customer needs.                                                         Alongside dramatic increases in D2C sales, Sonos also saw an increase in service requests. With a digital service strategy and single source of truth already in place, Sonos could scale to meet these increased requests by augmenting agents’ productivity with  and automated tools to resolve customer needs. For customers who prefer to speak with a live person for support, Sonos adopted a voice tool to deliver the same level of personalization and intelligence by phone, resulting in 10% faster call resolution. And with a convenient user community of knowledge articles, customers could also use self-service for quicker answers.“The customer doesn’t think about just needing service. They think about their entire experience with Sonos. So why wouldn’t we?” said Ruth Sleeter, , Sonos.Service Cloud equips teams with an omni-channel console, built-in productivity tools, automation, , and a unified view of every case detail and customer interaction.Service Cloud equips teams with an omni-channel console, built-in productivity tools, automation, , and a unified view of every case detail and customer interaction.Chatbots also allowed Sonos to address more customer needs, while providing an interactive experience. And because the chatbots are connected to , they can even help customers with requests like open case lookup or order status, resulting in a 40%+ deflection rate in case volume.Using a single view of each customer’s case and order history, agents can deliver more personalized and efficient service, saving 5 hours per week.Sonos is also wall-to-wall on Slack with several automated workflows, making it easy to operate as a cohesive unit despite working remotely across distributed teams. Teams can swarm on a case alongside service data to make informed decisions that result in seamless service experiences.Third party service agents can join the conversation too. Slack Connect allows Sonos to include them using shared channels — without requiring intense guest account management.And customers benefit from helpful, engaging experiences that they want to share with friends and family. Amidst the pandemic, Sonos was able to achieve its 16th year of revenue growth.          40%+                            deflection in                             case volume                                                              10%                            decrease in                             average call time                                                              5hours                            per week saved                             in productivity                                                                                            Learn more about Service Cloud                                                         Ready to implement strategic customer service?

By directly interacting with customers across commerce, service, and marketing, Sonos was able to increase its direct-to-consumer (D2C) share of the business — all from one integrated platform.Patrick Spence,  at Sonos, has been at the company for more than 12 years, applying his expertise in hardware and software technology to help listeners design the soundtrack of their lives. Because of the work he and his team had done upfront to build a connected platform, Sonos was able to quickly pivot to D2C experiences when it mattered most.Let’s take a look at how Patrick and the team at Sonos are using Salesforce Customer 360 to change how they grow their relationships with customers in ways that meet their evolving needs.

In this video (2:24), hear Sonos  Patrick Spence describe how the company pivoted to (and thrived with) direct-to-consumer operations almost overnight despite having a remote customer service team. With no brick-and-mortar retailer partners open to sell Sonos products during the early days of the pandemic, the company turned to its website to connect with customers directly.Because Sonos already had centralized data and a 360-degree view of customers in place, the company was able to address the flood of B2C transactions with seamless, connected digital experiences across every touchpoint, no matter which department consumers interacted with. And by scaling both digital commerce and marketing, Sonos was able to message and advise customers of changes or delays in fulfillment directly in shopping carts to set the right expectations with delivery estimates. To continue managing global dealer and installer relationships with seamless service, Sonos set up a B2B community that houses everything from knowledge articles to podcasts to act as the main source of information for business customers. With a digital service strategy and single source of truth already in place, Sonos could scale to meet these increased requests by augmenting agents’ productivity with  and automated tools to resolve customer needs. For customers who prefer to speak with a live person for support, Sonos adopted a voice tool to deliver the same level of personalization and intelligence by phone, resulting in 10% faster call resolution. And with a convenient user community of knowledge articles, customers could also use self-service for quicker answers.“The customer doesn’t think about just needing service. So why wouldn’t we?” said Ruth Sleeter, , Sonos.Service Cloud equips teams with an omni-channel console, built-in productivity tools, automation, , and a unified view of every case detail and customer interaction.Service Cloud equips teams with an omni-channel console, built-in productivity tools, automation, , and a unified view of every case detail and customer interaction.Chatbots also allowed Sonos to address more customer needs, while providing an interactive experience. And because the chatbots are connected to , they can even help customers with requests like open case lookup or order status, resulting in a 40%+ deflection rate in case volume.Using a single view of each customer’s case and order history, agents can deliver more personalized and efficient service, saving 5 hours per week.Sonos is also wall-to-wall on Slack with several automated workflows, making it easy to operate as a cohesive unit despite working remotely across distributed teams. Slack Connect allows Sonos to include them using shared channels — without requiring intense guest account management.And customers benefit from helpful, engaging experiences that they want to share with friends and family. Automated workflows within the platform have helped Sonos reduce training times and onboard new agents quicker by connecting multiple processes and teams into one seamless workflow — so employees can start helping customers faster.Plus, customer service managers can forecast service demand and build omni-channel capacity plans in real time with , ensuring proper staffing to deliver the best possible service. “With Service Cloud, our employees can collaborate across different organizations, data sets, and dashboards to deliver service in a consistent manner, no matter where they are in the world.”                                                                                      Dharam Rai                                                         Vice President of Customer Experience                            “With Service Cloud, our employees can collaborate across different organizations, data sets, and dashboards to deliver service in a consistent manner, no matter where they are in the world.”                                                                                     Dharam Rai                                                         Vice President of Customer Experience           	Sonos also powers its business with 29 app integrations.

When your business is largely dependent on travel and onsite visits, a global pandemic can completely derail your operations. But with a solid digital foundation and the right field technology, conducting business virtually is a cinch.
No one knows this better than Fike Corporation, a leading industrial safety manufacturer specializing in protection mechanisms and solutions. Yet, with 75 years under its belt and a rich family history, Fike had become accustomed to its legacy systems, resulting in expensive technician training, longer response times, and siloed data across the organization.
When COVID-19 hit, it served as a catalyst for ushering in a new digital age for Fike, resulting in faster, more efficient virtual processes and seamless data tracking across the business. With Chad Lowman, Director, Corp Business Systems at Fike, at the helm, the company was able to go remote in just two days and complete its digital transformation in 10 months.
Let’s take a look at how Chad and the Fike team use Salesforce Customer 360 and other technology to connect data, streamline the lead and quoting process, and provide impeccable customer service — even from afar.

Step 1: Connect the front and back office.

                2. Shift to virtual field service. 
            
            
            
            
        



Until recently, Fike has faced a complex, costly, and time-consuming process of flying its service technicians to onsite appointments when needed. But with remote work mandates and travel restrictions caused by the pandemic, Fike needed a way to service customer parts without risk.
Fike adopted a field service solution that could partner with its new virtual assistant provider, SightCall. Together, the solution allows Fike to remotely train technicians onsite and easily walk them through repair processes. Using their phones, employees can take augmented reality measurements and solve problems faster, resulting in a 90% reduction in travel costs and 70% decrease in customer response times.

Digital transformation was also necessary in Fike’s sales department, where connecting leads to the right quote was previously a time-consuming process. By consolidating sales data into a single quote-to-cash platform, Fike automated its lead management and quoting process, while improving accuracy.
To test how easy it would be to customize workflows within the new platform and collaborate globally, Fike held a virtual CPQ hackathon to reimagine the company’s sales and business processes across its three product lines. The hackathon revealed a number of solutions, including the ability to:

Quote by item name instead of parts numbers
Develop workflows to reduce manufacturing overhead and increase margins
Create more accurate bills of material to reduce selling incorrect parts

                4. Collaborate across teams. 
            
            
            
            
        



One of the reasons for the hackathon’s success was the ability for teams to quickly and easily collaborate virtually. With participants across the globe, Fike teams were able to collaborate over the same documents in real time, managing communications and executing as quickly as possible. Going forward, Fike sales, service, and engineering teams can quickly and easily collaborate in real time to stay informed and productive across customer accounts and new projects.
“The online method is working better than in real life because it’s helping keep people accountable with time management,” said Chad. “They’ve knocked out several great deliverables in a short amount of time.”
With a fully digitized solution for sales and service, Fike is discovering new ways of doing business efficiently, no matter where its technicians and employees work from. As more companies return to work, new and old processes may be at odds, but having a connected platform to launch from will allow for newfound agility and productivity.

","How Fike Delivers Revolutionary Sales and Service Under Pressure - Salesforce.comSkip to content                                                                                                                                                                                                            How Fike Delivers Revolutionary Sales and Service Under Pressure                                                                   When your business is largely dependent on travel and onsite visits, a global pandemic can completely derail your operations. But with a solid digital foundation and the right field technology, conducting business virtually is a cinch.No one knows this better than Fike Corporation, a leading industrial safety manufacturer specializing in protection mechanisms and solutions. Yet, with 75 years under its belt and a rich family history, Fike had become accustomed to its legacy systems, resulting in expensive technician training, longer response times, and siloed data across the organization.When -19 hit, it served as a catalyst for ushering in a new digital age for Fike, resulting in faster, more efficient virtual processes and seamless data tracking across the business. With Chad Lowman, Director, Corp Business Systems at Fike, at the helm, the company was able to go remote in just two days and complete its digital transformation in 10 months.Let’s take a look at how Chad and the Fike team use Salesforce Customer 360 and other technology to connect data, streamline the lead and quoting process, and provide impeccable customer service — even from afar.                                      “We've gone through a metamorphosis. We’ve been challenged by our  and executive leadership to reinvent everything we do. We see  as an opportunity for us to emerge as a completely reformed company.”                                                                                      Chad Lowman                                                         Director, Corp Business Systems                            “We've gone through a metamorphosis.

Until recently, Fike has faced a complex, costly, and time-consuming process of flying its service technicians to onsite appointments when needed. But with remote work mandates and travel restrictions caused by the pandemic, Fike needed a way to service customer parts without risk.Fike adopted a field service solution that could partner with its new virtual assistant provider, SightCall. Together, the solution allows Fike to remotely train technicians onsite and easily walk them through repair processes. Using their phones, employees can take augmented reality measurements and solve problems faster, resulting in a 90% reduction in travel costs and 70% decrease in customer response times.In this Service Edge Summit video [17:21], Chad Lowman, Director, Corp Business Systems, explains how getting service right is crucial to the business of saving lives.

Streamline lead management and quoting.                                                         Digital transformation was also necessary in Fike’s sales department, where connecting leads to the right quote was previously a time-consuming process. By consolidating sales data into a single quote-to-cash platform, Fike automated its lead management and quoting process, while improving accuracy.To test how easy it would be to customize workflows within the new platform and collaborate globally, Fike held a virtual  hackathon to reimagine the company’s sales and business processes across its three product lines. The hackathon revealed a number of solutions, including the ability to:Quote by item name instead of parts numbersDevelop workflows to reduce manufacturing overhead and increase marginsCreate more accurate bills of material to reduce selling incorrect parts                                      Trailblazer Spotlight                                                         	Aaron White is a Business Systems Analyst, Developer at Fike. During Fike’s virtual  hackathon, Aaron built custom objects and flows to gather end users’ input.                            “I was able to build a dynamic solution thanks to the knowledge I gained from the Build Flows with Flow Builder Trail on Trailhead.”                                                                                     Aaron White                                                         Business Systems Analyst Developer                              Learn to automate a business process with Flow Builder                                          “I was able to build a dynamic solution thanks to the knowledge I gained from the Build Flows with Flow Builder Trail on Trailhead.”                                                                                     Aaron White                                                         Business Systems Analyst Developer                               Learn to automate a business process with Flow Builder                                                    Trailblazer Spotlight                                                         	Aaron White is a Business Systems Analyst, Developer at Fike.

Collaborate across teams.                                                         One of the reasons for the hackathon’s success was the ability for teams to quickly and easily collaborate virtually. With participants across the globe, Fike teams were able to collaborate over the same documents in real time, managing communications and executing as quickly as possible. Going forward, Fike sales, service, and engineering teams can quickly and easily collaborate in real time to stay informed and productive across customer accounts and new projects.“The online method is working better than in real life because it’s helping keep people accountable with time management,” said Chad. “They’ve knocked out several great deliverables in a short amount of time.”With a fully digitized solution for sales and service, Fike is discovering new ways of doing business efficiently, no matter where its technicians and employees work from. As more companies return to work, new and old processes may be at odds, but having a connected platform to launch from will allow for newfound agility and productivity.                                 More Resources                                                              The Manufacturer’s Playbook for Ecosystem Collaboration                            Guide                                                                                     The Manufacturer’s Playbook for Ecosystem Collaboration                                                         The Manufacturer’s Playbook for Ecosystem CollaborationEbook: The Power of                             Guide                                                                                     Build Your Business with the Power of                                                          Ebook: The Power of erfect the Customer Experience in Field Service                            Article                                                                                     Perfect the Customer Experience in Field Service                                                         Perfect the Customer Experience in Field Service                                      Get timely updates and fresh ideas delivered to your inbox.

Now, standard operations such as scheduling, capacity planning, and financial data tracking are integrated with the company’s new sales automation and customer service systems for shared visibility across the business. But with remote work mandates and travel restrictions caused by the pandemic, Fike needed a way to service customer parts without risk.Fike adopted a field service solution that could partner with its new virtual assistant provider, SightCall. Using their phones, employees can take augmented reality measurements and solve problems faster, resulting in a 90% reduction in travel costs and 70% decrease in customer response times.In this Service Edge Summit video [17:21], Chad Lowman, Director, Corp Business Systems, explains how getting service right is crucial to the business of saving lives.

By consolidating sales data into a single quote-to-cash platform, Fike automated its lead management and quoting process, while improving accuracy.To test how easy it would be to customize workflows within the new platform and collaborate globally, Fike held a virtual  hackathon to reimagine the company’s sales and business processes across its three product lines. The hackathon revealed a number of solutions, including the ability to:Quote by item name instead of parts numbersDevelop workflows to reduce manufacturing overhead and increase marginsCreate more accurate bills of material to reduce selling incorrect parts                                      Trailblazer Spotlight                                                         	Aaron White is a Business Systems Analyst, Developer at Fike.

                Manage incidents from a single screen. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Give agents and service operations teams full visibility into incidents, cases, and customer data in a single workspace. Agents are no longer left in the dark while being bombarded by frustrated customers. And service operations teams have all the context they need to resolve the problem.















 
    










            
                Stay one step ahead of major disruptions. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Proactively address problems before customers even know about them. Integrate with external systems so you can find and resolve issues before they have widespread impact.














 
    




            
                Automate processes with intelligence. 
            
            
            
            
        



	Use AI to point out incidents based on high volumes of similar incoming cases. Then, expedite the problem solving process with automatically surfaced learnings from previous incidents.















 
    










            
                Find the right experts at the right time. 
            
            
            
            
        



Slack helps you quickly take action by connecting the right experts across internal and external teams. With swarming built into the console, you can tackle incidents and escalations faster and more efficiently than ever before.

	Build trust and confidence between you and your customers by updating them on the status of their cases. Seamlessly connect with customers and keep them updated using digital channels like email, messaging, social, and web – all native to the Salesforce platform. When customers know their case is actively being worked on, they’re less likely to reach out to the call center.

                    What is Service Cloud?
                





Service Cloud is built on Salesforce Customer 360, giving you a 360-degree view of your customers and enabling you to deliver smarter, faster, and more personalized service.
In addition to being a pioneer in cloud-based sales force automation, Salesforce is the recognized leader for CRM customer engagement. With Service Cloud, you can automate service processes, streamline workflows, and surface key articles, topics, and experts to transform the agent experience. Connecting one-to-one with every customer, across multiple channels and on any device, was never easier.

                    How can Service Cloud help my business increase loyalty, retention, and satisfaction?
                





When your customers have questions, your customer service team needs to be equipped to answer them quickly and easily. When your customer service is frictionless, customers are more likely to return to your product or service. Service Cloud gives agents the tools to deliver an outstanding customer experience, enabling them to work faster and more productively, which improves customer satisfaction and reduces costs. And with Service Cloud and Customer Communities, you can create a self-service community that allows customers to tap into the best information about your product, connect with peers, or contact a support agent when needed.

                    How does Service Cloud increase agent productivity?
                





	The Salesforce Lightning Console was designed with agent productivity in mind. With features such as email to case, skills-based routing, macros, and milestone tracking, Service Cloud gives agents the tools to quickly and efficiently respond to customers on any channel. Agents enjoy a streamlined, intuitive experience that gives them a 360-degree view of your customers, a comprehensive knowledge base, and access to company experts. It’s not just about your agents; your entire organization can glean insights from a case history or help provide technical expertise that answers a common service question.

                    What is social customer service and how can this help my business?
                





	Treat social channels just like email and phone. Listen and respond to customers across a variety of social platforms and automatically route social cases to the right agent at the right time. Because social customer service is an integrated, seamless part of Salesforce Customer 360, your social care team gains a comprehensive picture of the customer before responding. This 360-degree view of the customer empowers agents with the ability to engage customers on the social channels where they are talking.

                    What is a self-service community and how can it help my business?
                





A self-service community is a customer portal that allows you to help customers help themselves. Delivering self-service means showcasing your knowledge base and offering case management to customers, so they can get answers to their questions anytime, on any device, from community content or peers. This allows your agents to focus on solving the most complex issues. And you can even create an internal self-service community for your employees to collaborate around content and business processes. 

With Service Cloud and Community Cloud, you can deliver a self-service community or customer portal that is an extension of your brand, while enabling agents to jump on the case when needed, so no question goes unanswered. Extend your support via a fully branded experience where customers — and employees — can tap into articles and discussions, and ask questions of other community members or agents with Service Cloud and Community Cloud.

                    What mobile solutions does Service Cloud provide?

Service Cloud offers Embedded Service for In-App Mobile & Web, which let you embed customer support directly into your apps.

                Introduction 
            
            
            
            
        



The service landscape is shifting. Consumers today are more connected, informed, and empowered than ever before. The immediate effect of this change? Service expectations are rising: connected consumers expect companies to be just as connected as they are. They expect and demand the ability to solve problems quickly, across any combination of communication channels they prefer.
This presents a fundamental challenge for every company, regardless of size or industry. In this new service landscape, delivering the world-class customer experience that connected customers expect isn’t just nice to have — it is mandatory for any business that wants to succeed.
As Senior Vice President of Service Cloud Product Marketing, I’ve had the unique opportunity to help define how new technology will shape customer service. Here, I’m excited to share my thoughts on the future of service, and how companies can successfully adapt and thrive in this new service paradigm. 





            
                What’s your overall vision for service — not just for Salesforce, but across the industry? 
            
            
            
            
        



Sarah Patterson: The business of customer service is changing and evolving every day as consumers change and evolve. And we are partnering with our customers to provide the world's #1 customer service to help them meet these new expectations. Service is the new sales. A company’s relationship with consumers is defined by the quality, level, effort, and comfort of the service it provides. I think that message has been in the industry for awhile, but now, with technology and agility, you’re able to achieve it. So, companies are truly differentiating themselves, and consumers are making buying decisions, based on the kinds of services that companies are offering. Today, customer experience has surpassed price and product as the key differentiator among brands. What this really means is that your product is only as good as your service. 
In prior decades, service was something that was very hard to stand up, hard to maintain, and very hard to change. In this new world, you have to be able to operate at the speed of your customers. You have to be nimble and agile and create new kinds of service, new kinds of channels, and new ways of supporting your customers — because they’re changing rapidly, and they’re changing dramatically. 





            
                What are the service implications for the Internet of Things? 
            
            
            
            
        



Sarah Patterson: The Internet of Things gives companies an incredible new opportunity to connect and engage their consumers in a personal way. The Internet of Things is about devices and products being connected. The technology itself, like connected thermostats and health devices, is incredible, but what’s really powerful is that these devices can send information back to companies that they can use to gain insights into how people are using their products. These insights allow companies to make their service even more personalized. So the part about IoT that I think should be focused on for the world of service is: What is the recipient of the IoT information going to do, and how do you use this information to engage with your customers on a whole new level? 
For example, your doctor sees you once a year and he or she tries to determine if you’re healthy or not based on that visit. Well, what if that doctor saw you every day? What would your doctor say if they could look at data from a Fitbit, for instance, and see critical information about your wellness and detect patterns and trends? 












            
                How have mobile devices changed the way companies deliver service? 
            
            
            
            
        



Sarah Patterson: The presence of mobile devices in the world is astounding: there are now 5 billion smartphones. A majority of young children have access to a full-time mobile device, and for some it may be the main way they access the internet every day. What that really means for businesses and individuals is that every company needs to think mobile first. In this new world, people expect to engage with companies and brands through apps. And the last thing customers want to do is leave that mobile app to get service, to get help, or find answers to questions they have. As a company, you want to provide service in that app because that’s where your customers live, and you want the same experience across every device.
The other interesting expectation that has changed is that customers expect businesses to provide a seamless customer experience across any channel they use. Think of your own customer experiences. It’s not unusual for me to use multiple channels when I’m trying to get a question answered. The other day, for example, I was flying across the country from the East Coast when my flight was canceled because of the weather. I got in line at the airport to talk to a rep about getting on a new flight. At the same time, I got on my mobile phone and sent an email to the airline asking for help. And then, before I even got to the front of the line, I also called customer service to see if they could help me find a new flight even faster. This experience is not unusual for most consumers. And the expectation I had was that they would know that I had emailed and called and that the person I spoke to next had that context of what was happening with my case, no matter what channel I used.
To help companies with this, our AI-powered customer service platform fuels smarter customer service with data science. Service Cloud routes these multiple conversations to the same agent, ensuring the best customer experience by giving the agent an omni-channel view across all of these channels. It also looks at the skills of the agents and what cases they’ve worked on in the past, and uses that intelligence to find the agent who is best suited to help with that case. This new level of intelligence in the tools being used in customer service is becoming essential for the truly modern service organization. And it helps ensure that companies are taking the friction out of the service experience.





            
                 Do you think it’s accurate that customers would rather have a frictionless customer experience than be delighted or amazed? 
            
            
            
            
        



	Sarah Patterson: I think it’s entirely accurate. Customer delight is really a false notion — “Oh, we’re going to fix all your problems.” The reality is, if somebody is taking the time to interact with your company, they’re really having a problem. And even if you delight them, they still contacted you because they had a problem. So the best thing you can do is stop them from having a problem in the first place. Some companies spend a lot of time and energy on wowing their customers, but the studies actually suggest that it doesn’t do anything for either customer stats or propensity to buy.





            
                 How is customer connectivity impacting service? 
            
            
            
            
        



Sarah Patterson: When customers are more connected, companies need to be omnipresent. Think of your own service experience. If you have a problem, what’s the first thing you do? You might call the company; you also might Google or search to see if anybody else has that same problem or issue. You might go on YouTube and watch a video. Now think about what that experience was like 10 years ago: As a consumer, you had relatively little access to information. If you called support or engaged with anyone in support, whatever they told you — that was the answer.
I don’t know about you, but I don’t know how many times I’ve had a question and immediately jumped on Google to try to find the answer first before reaching out to the company. This means that companies need to think about being on all of these channels where customers may look for information. And it means that their strategy has to evolve from offering their customers a few ways to get in touch, to being able to see all the ways customers are trying to get in touch and being present on those channels and in those communities. 





            
                With all of this connectedness comes a lot more data. How do companies parse through it in a meaningful way?   
            
            
            
            
        



Sarah Patterson: That is a challenge! Salesforce Einstein Analytics provides service agents and managers access to the real-time data that they need to make decisions. 
Think about the power of putting analytics into anyone’s hands so that they can use that data to make better decisions about how to help customers. 
Imagine you’re a global brand manager for a consumer company. Every day, you want to see how many incidents are occurring with your product, how many people are unhappy with the packaging, so that you can make decisions about what you’re doing from a product standpoint based on the data that’s coming in real time from the consumer relations department. That’s what I mean by connected. It’s connected externally — against the customer who’s more connected — and it’s connected internally. 





            
                What kinds of data and metrics are most important in this new age of service? 
            
            
            
            
        



Sarah Patterson: In the world of service, there’s these dinosaur metrics — first call resolution, average speed of answer, average case time, average handle time — and these have been around for 30 or 40 years because they were based on the expectations that customers had at that time. But customers’ expectations are changing. And that means there will have to be a new round of metrics, like second call avoidance, to help companies meet their customers’ new expectations.
Let me give you an example. As a consumer, you might tolerate having a problem with your hotel room one time, if they gave you a single bed when you had requested two beds. You might call in to request a change and tolerate that they made that mistake. But the next time you check in, if that’s not fixed, you’re going to be really, really frustrated, and if you have to call in again to get the same problem fixed, then that company risks losing you as a customer. So the best thing the brand can do is to fix the issue for you the first time so that it never happens again. If somebody calls one time, they should never have to call again — that’s second call avoidance.
The Lightning Service Console was designed to give the agent every piece of information that the company has about its customer, and it’s amazing that we have this unprecedented access to data about the problems customers are facing. 
But what are you doing with the data you’re getting so you can eliminate those problems in the future? I hope that people are using the data so that they can understand the friction that’s occurring with their customers and they’re making business changes to eliminate that friction. 





            
                What are the service expectations for millennials versus older generations? 
            
            
            
            
        



Sarah Patterson: Younger generations, including millennials, are more mobile, more social, and less loyal to brands like they used to be. What are they loyal to? Their customer experience, which all comes down to the company’s customer service. 
Millennials are willing to provide more information about themselves, who they are, and what they like, in order to have a better customer experience. 
If you think about the car-sharing service Lyft, you willingly give out your GPS information in order to get a ride — you don’t even think twice about it, because you know you’re going to get the experience of being picked up exactly where you want to be picked up, and because they make it easy and effortless for you. So people are increasingly willing to give up certain information to get better experiences and better services, as long as they get that in a safe and secure way and understand what they get in return for that information.





            
                 I’ve heard you talk about using service tools internally to engage employees. Can you talk about how we can apply this new age of service inside a company? 
            
            
            
            
        



Sarah Patterson: As a customer, you get amazing service from consumer products. But when you go inside of your company and you think about the kind of service that you get from the day you start working, do you have the same experience?
Think about when you have a problem with your laptop, or an issue with payroll. Do you search an internal knowledge base for laptop troubleshooting? Do you visit a peer community, where others who have experienced the same payroll issue can advise you? Or do you end up emailing someone in human resources because you can’t find the answer you want? 
This is just one example of how the technology and best practices of customer service can be applied throughout your business — to HR, and to every other department. When you think about what customer service represents, it’s all about the best way to engage with somebody. That’s where the money’s at. So you should be able to navigate internal issues in the same way that you navigate as a consumer — there’s a knowledge base, and there’s a way to interact with other community members, a way to chat and easily find answers. It’s an engagement layer that can be added onto every business function — including HR.
And this world is evolving as well. The first evolution of customer service was a transition from systems of record to systems of integration — from having the right information to actually integrating it into our business processes. Now, we’re evolving again. The next phase will be all about systems of intelligence — using data science to act intelligently on the right data at the right time to deliver consistently amazing customer experiences. Think of the impact you could have on your business if you used those same insights and data science to deliver amazing experiences to your employees — how happy, efficient and productive would they be. Doesn’t that sound like a place you’d want to work? 





            
                Conclusion 
            
            
            
            
        



	In today’s connected world, the quality of the customer experience your company delivers is of paramount importance. Your product, after all, is only as good as your service. But exceptional service no longer means solving a customer’s problem when they pick up the phone — it’s about taking preventive measures and proactively solving potential problems. It’s about providing service that the customer may not even see or realize is happening. The Service Cloud platform enables modern businesses to tackle these challenges head- on, and provide exceptional service designed for a new, connected world of customers.

Consumers today are more connected, informed, and empowered than ever before. The immediate effect of this change? Service expectations are rising: connected consumers expect companies to be just as connected as they are. They expect and demand the ability to solve problems quickly, across any combination of communication channels they prefer.This presents a fundamental challenge for every company, regardless of size or industry. In this new service landscape, delivering the world-class customer experience that connected customers expect isn’t just nice to have — it is mandatory for any business that wants to succeed.As Senior Vice President of Service Cloud Product Marketing, I’ve had the unique opportunity to help define how new technology will shape customer service. Here, I’m excited to share my thoughts on the future of service, and how companies can successfully adapt and thrive in this new service paradigm.                             What’s your overall vision for service — not just for Salesforce, but across the industry?                                                         Sarah Patterson: The business of customer service is changing and evolving every day as consumers change and evolve. And we are partnering with our customers to provide the world's #1 customer service to help them meet these new expectations. Service is the new sales. A company’s relationship with consumers is defined by the quality, level, effort, and comfort of the service it provides. I think that message has been in the industry for awhile, but now, with technology and agility, you’re able to achieve it. So, companies are truly differentiating themselves, and consumers are making buying decisions, based on the kinds of services that companies are offering. Today, customer experience has surpassed price and product as the key differentiator among brands. What this really means is that your product is only as good as your service. In prior decades, service was something that was very hard to stand up, hard to maintain, and very hard to change. In this new world, you have to be able to operate at the speed of your customers. You have to be nimble and agile and create new kinds of service, new kinds of channels, and new ways of supporting your customers — because they’re changing rapidly, and they’re changing dramatically.                             What are the service implications for the Internet of Things?                                                         Sarah Patterson: The Internet of Things gives companies an incredible new opportunity to connect and engage their consumers in a personal way. The Internet of Things is about devices and products being connected. The technology itself, like connected thermostats and health devices, is incredible, but what’s really powerful is that these devices can send information back to companies that they can use to gain insights into how people are using their products. These insights allow companies to make their service even more personalized. So the part about IoT that I think should be focused on for the world of service is: What is the recipient of the IoT information going to do, and how do you use this information to engage with your customers on a whole new level? For example, your doctor sees you once a year and he or she tries to determine if you’re healthy or not based on that visit. Well, what if that doctor saw you every day? What would your doctor say if they could look at data from a Fitbit, for instance, and see critical information about your wellness and detect patterns and trends?                             How have mobile devices changed the way companies deliver service?                                                         Sarah Patterson: The presence of mobile devices in the world is astounding: there are now 5 billion smartphones. A majority of young children have access to a full-time mobile device, and for some it may be the main way they access the internet every day. What that really means for businesses and individuals is that every company needs to think mobile first. In this new world, people expect to engage with companies and brands through apps. And the last thing customers want to do is leave that mobile app to get service, to get help, or find answers to questions they have. As a company, you want to provide service in that app because that’s where your customers live, and you want the same experience across every device.The other interesting expectation that has changed is that customers expect businesses to provide a seamless customer experience across any channel they use. Think of your own customer experiences. It’s not unusual for me to use multiple channels when I’m trying to get a question answered. The other day, for example, I was flying across the country from the East Coast when my flight was canceled because of the weather. I got in line at the airport to talk to a rep about getting on a new flight. At the same time, I got on my mobile phone and sent an email to the airline asking for help. And then, before I even got to the front of the line, I also called customer service to see if they could help me find a new flight even faster. This experience is not unusual for most consumers. And the expectation I had was that they would know that I had emailed and called and that the person I spoke to next had that context of what was happening with my case, no matter what channel I used.To help companies with this, our -powered customer service platform fuels smarter customer service with data science. Service Cloud routes these multiple conversations to the same agent, ensuring the best customer experience by giving the agent an omni-channel view across all of these channels. It also looks at the skills of the agents and what cases they’ve worked on in the past, and uses that intelligence to find the agent who is best suited to help with that case. This new level of intelligence in the tools being used in customer service is becoming essential for the truly modern service organization. And it helps ensure that companies are taking the friction out of the service experience.                             Do you think it’s accurate that customers would rather have a frictionless customer experience than be delighted or amazed?                                                         	Sarah Patterson: I think it’s entirely accurate. Customer delight is really a false notion — “Oh, we’re going to fix all your problems.” The reality is, if somebody is taking the time to interact with your company, they’re really having a problem. And even if you delight them, they still contacted you because they had a problem. So the best thing you can do is stop them from having a problem in the first place. Some companies spend a lot of time and energy on wowing their customers, but the studies actually suggest that it doesn’t do anything for either customer stats or propensity to buy.                             How is customer connectivity impacting service?                                                         Sarah Patterson: When customers are more connected, companies need to be omnipresent. Think of your own service experience. If you have a problem, what’s the first thing you do? You might call the company; you also might Google or search to see if anybody else has that same problem or issue. You might go on YouTube and watch a video. Now think about what that experience was like 10 years ago: As a consumer, you had relatively little access to information. If you called support or engaged with anyone in support, whatever they told you — that was the answer.I don’t know about you, but I don’t know how many times I’ve had a question and immediately jumped on Google to try to find the answer first before reaching out to the company. This means that companies need to think about being on all of these channels where customers may look for information. And it means that their strategy has to evolve from offering their customers a few ways to get in touch, to being able to see all the ways customers are trying to get in touch and being present on those channels and in those communities.                             With all of this connectedness comes a lot more data. How do companies parse through it in a meaningful way?                                                           Sarah Patterson: That is a challenge! Salesforce Einstein Analytics provides service agents and managers access to the real-time data that they need to make decisions. Think about the power of putting analytics into anyone’s hands so that they can use that data to make better decisions about how to help customers. Imagine you’re a global brand manager for a consumer company. Every day, you want to see how many incidents are occurring with your product, how many people are unhappy with the packaging, so that you can make decisions about what you’re doing from a product standpoint based on the data that’s coming in real time from the consumer relations department. That’s what I mean by connected. It’s connected externally — against the customer who’s more connected — and it’s connected internally.                             What kinds of data and metrics are most important in this new age of service?                                                         Sarah Patterson: In the world of service, there’s these dinosaur metrics — first call resolution, average speed of answer, average case time, average handle time — and these have been around for 30 or 40 years because they were based on the expectations that customers had at that time. But customers’ expectations are changing. And that means there will have to be a new round of metrics, like second call avoidance, to help companies meet their customers’ new expectations.Let me give you an example. As a consumer, you might tolerate having a problem with your hotel room one time, if they gave you a single bed when you had requested two beds. You might call in to request a change and tolerate that they made that mistake. But the next time you check in, if that’s not fixed, you’re going to be really, really frustrated, and if you have to call in again to get the same problem fixed, then that company risks losing you as a customer. So the best thing the brand can do is to fix the issue for you the first time so that it never happens again. If somebody calls one time, they should never have to call again — that’s second call avoidance.The Lightning Service Console was designed to give the agent every piece of information that the company has about its customer, and it’s amazing that we have this unprecedented access to data about the problems customers are facing. But what are you doing with the data you’re getting so you can eliminate those problems in the future? I hope that people are using the data so that they can understand the friction that’s occurring with their customers and they’re making business changes to eliminate that friction.                             What are the service expectations for millennials versus older generations?                                                         Sarah Patterson: Younger generations, including millennials, are more mobile, more social, and less loyal to brands like they used to be. What are they loyal to? Their customer experience, which all comes down to the company’s customer service. Millennials are willing to provide more information about themselves, who they are, and what they like, in order to have a better customer experience. If you think about the car-sharing service Lyft, you willingly give out your  information in order to get a ride — you don’t even think twice about it, because you know you’re going to get the experience of being picked up exactly where you want to be picked up, and because they make it easy and effortless for you. So people are increasingly willing to give up certain information to get better experiences and better services, as long as they get that in a safe and secure way and understand what they get in return for that information.                             I’ve heard you talk about using service tools internally to engage employees. Can you talk about how we can apply this new age of service inside a company?                                                         Sarah Patterson: As a customer, you get amazing service from consumer products. But when you go inside of your company and you think about the kind of service that you get from the day you start working, do you have the same experience?Think about when you have a problem with your laptop, or an issue with payroll. Do you search an internal knowledge base for laptop troubleshooting? Do you visit a peer community, where others who have experienced the same payroll issue can advise you? Or do you end up emailing someone in human resources because you can’t find the answer you want? This is just one example of how the technology and best practices of customer service can be applied throughout your business — to , and to every other department. When you think about what customer service represents, it’s all about the best way to engage with somebody. That’s where the money’s at. So you should be able to navigate internal issues in the same way that you navigate as a consumer — there’s a knowledge base, and there’s a way to interact with other community members, a way to chat and easily find answers. It’s an engagement layer that can be added onto every business function — including .And this world is evolving as well. The first evolution of customer service was a transition from systems of record to systems of integration — from having the right information to actually integrating it into our business processes. Now, we’re evolving again. The next phase will be all about systems of intelligence — using data science to act intelligently on the right data at the right time to deliver consistently amazing customer experiences. Think of the impact you could have on your business if you used those same insights and data science to deliver amazing experiences to your employees — how happy, efficient and productive would they be. Doesn’t that sound like a place you’d want to work?                             Conclusion                                                         	In today’s connected world, the quality of the customer experience your company delivers is of paramount importance. Your product, after all, is only as good as your service. But exceptional service no longer means solving a customer’s problem when they pick up the phone — it’s about taking preventive measures and proactively solving potential problems. It’s about providing service that the customer may not even see or realize is happening. The Service Cloud platform enables modern businesses to tackle these challenges head- on, and provide exceptional service designed for a new, connected world of customers. Read More                                 Resources                                                                                          Free 30-day Trial of Service Cloud                                                                                       Try for free              Connect Sales and Service Around the Customer                            Connect Sales and Service Around the Customer                                                                                       Get the report              Connect Sales and Service Around the Customer                                 Related Content                                                         Customer Service Content Center - Fortune: The New Brand Battleground                            Report                                                                                     Customer Service: The New Brand Battleground                                                                                                       Customer Service Content Center - Fortune: The New Brand Battleground                                                                                                                 See a Demo of the #1 Customer Service Platform                                                                                                      Customer Service Content Center - 25 Tips and Tricks for Amazing Customer Service                                                                                                                 25 Tips for Amazing Customer Service                                                                                                       Customer Service Content Center - 25 Tips and Tricks for Amazing Customer Service                            Questions?

The New Age of Service                                                         Sarah Patterson, , Service Cloud Product Marketing                                   <                                                                             Introduction                                                         The service landscape is shifting. In this new service landscape, delivering the world-class customer experience that connected customers expect isn’t just nice to have — it is mandatory for any business that wants to succeed.As Senior Vice President of Service Cloud Product Marketing, I’ve had the unique opportunity to help define how new technology will shape customer service. Here, I’m excited to share my thoughts on the future of service, and how companies can successfully adapt and thrive in this new service paradigm. A company’s relationship with consumers is defined by the quality, level, effort, and comfort of the service it provides. So, companies are truly differentiating themselves, and consumers are making buying decisions, based on the kinds of services that companies are offering. In this new world, you have to be able to operate at the speed of your customers. You have to be nimble and agile and create new kinds of service, new kinds of channels, and new ways of supporting your customers — because they’re changing rapidly, and they’re changing dramatically. The technology itself, like connected thermostats and health devices, is incredible, but what’s really powerful is that these devices can send information back to companies that they can use to gain insights into how people are using their products. So the part about IoT that I think should be focused on for the world of service is: What is the recipient of the IoT information going to do, and how do you use this information to engage with your customers on a whole new level? And the last thing customers want to do is leave that mobile app to get service, to get help, or find answers to questions they have. As a company, you want to provide service in that app because that’s where your customers live, and you want the same experience across every device.The other interesting expectation that has changed is that customers expect businesses to provide a seamless customer experience across any channel they use. And then, before I even got to the front of the line, I also called customer service to see if they could help me find a new flight even faster. And the expectation I had was that they would know that I had emailed and called and that the person I spoke to next had that context of what was happening with my case, no matter what channel I used.To help companies with this, our -powered customer service platform fuels smarter customer service with data science. Service Cloud routes these multiple conversations to the same agent, ensuring the best customer experience by giving the agent an omni-channel view across all of these channels. It also looks at the skills of the agents and what cases they’ve worked on in the past, and uses that intelligence to find the agent who is best suited to help with that case. Customer delight is really a false notion — “Oh, we’re going to fix all your problems.” The reality is, if somebody is taking the time to interact with your company, they’re really having a problem. Some companies spend a lot of time and energy on wowing their customers, but the studies actually suggest that it doesn’t do anything for either customer stats or propensity to buy. Sarah Patterson: When customers are more connected, companies need to be omnipresent. If you called support or engaged with anyone in support, whatever they told you — that was the answer.I don’t know about you, but I don’t know how many times I’ve had a question and immediately jumped on Google to try to find the answer first before reaching out to the company. And it means that their strategy has to evolve from offering their customers a few ways to get in touch, to being able to see all the ways customers are trying to get in touch and being present on those channels and in those communities. Every day, you want to see how many incidents are occurring with your product, how many people are unhappy with the packaging, so that you can make decisions about what you’re doing from a product standpoint based on the data that’s coming in real time from the consumer relations department. Sarah Patterson: In the world of service, there’s these dinosaur metrics — first call resolution, average speed of answer, average case time, average handle time — and these have been around for 30 or 40 years because they were based on the expectations that customers had at that time. And that means there will have to be a new round of metrics, like second call avoidance, to help companies meet their customers’ new expectations.Let me give you an example. But the next time you check in, if that’s not fixed, you’re going to be really, really frustrated, and if you have to call in again to get the same problem fixed, then that company risks losing you as a customer. If somebody calls one time, they should never have to call again — that’s second call avoidance.The Lightning Service Console was designed to give the agent every piece of information that the company has about its customer, and it’s amazing that we have this unprecedented access to data about the problems customers are facing. Their customer experience, which all comes down to the company’s customer service. If you think about the car-sharing service Lyft, you willingly give out your  information in order to get a ride — you don’t even think twice about it, because you know you’re going to get the experience of being picked up exactly where you want to be picked up, and because they make it easy and effortless for you. So people are increasingly willing to give up certain information to get better experiences and better services, as long as they get that in a safe and secure way and understand what they get in return for that information. Sarah Patterson: As a customer, you get amazing service from consumer products. But when you go inside of your company and you think about the kind of service that you get from the day you start working, do you have the same experience?Think about when you have a problem with your laptop, or an issue with payroll. This is just one example of how the technology and best practices of customer service can be applied throughout your business — to , and to every other department. When you think about what customer service represents, it’s all about the best way to engage with somebody. So you should be able to navigate internal issues in the same way that you navigate as a consumer — there’s a knowledge base, and there’s a way to interact with other community members, a way to chat and easily find answers. Think of the impact you could have on your business if you used those same insights and data science to deliver amazing experiences to your employees — how happy, efficient and productive would they be. Conclusion                                                         	In today’s connected world, the quality of the customer experience your company delivers is of paramount importance. But exceptional service no longer means solving a customer’s problem when they pick up the phone — it’s about taking preventive measures and proactively solving potential problems.

What is channel sales?
In channel sales, companies (here we’ll call them vendors) sell through intermediaries. These intermediaries go by many names in different contexts: partners, resellers, dealers, distributors, brokers, agents, affiliates — the list goes on. This business model is also called indirect selling, because the company doesn’t have a direct connection to the end customer. 
What is the difference between channel sales and direct sales? 








While indirect sales uses a go-between, direct selling does not. Under a direct sales model, the brand sells straight to the end consumer. For instance, a brand might sell through its own retail store or its own website.
Many companies use a mix of direct and indirect sales. They may have customers who prefer buying through a channel (for example, a third-party retail store), while other customers might prefer buying from the manufacturer. Below are a few examples to help illustrate this point.





            
                Direct sales: Sales where the company sells directly to the end customer. 
            
            
            
            
        





            
                Indirect sales: Sales that use an intermediary such as partners, resellers, dealers, or brokers. Also called channel sales. 
            
            
            
            
        








                        Examples of channel sales
                    





Indirect selling happens across an array of industries, and often goes by different names.
 

Affiliates. Affiliates are websites that get paid a commission to send customers to a merchant’s website. A makeup brand might use beauty bloggers or social influencers as affiliates to promote its lip gloss and bronzers online.
Alliances. Alliances are partnerships with companies that sell complementary products. For instance, a cloud software company might provide enterprise storage in partnership with another tech company.

Dealers. Dealers serve as an intermediary between customers and the manufacturer. Car manufacturers sell through dealerships.

Distributors. Distributors buy directly from the businesses, then market and sell to customers in their operating regions. For instance, a beverage manufacturer sells directly to distributors, who then sell those products to stores and restaurants in a specific geographic area.
Franchisees. Franchisees pay to use a brand’s identity, processes, and business model to sell that brand’s products or services. Some gyms license their brand to independently owned and operated franchise locations.

Resellers or VARs. Resellers or value-added resellers (VARs) purchase existing products with the intention of reselling them, often adding features or services to enhance value. Many software companies sell through resellers or VARs.

Independent brokers or agents. Brokers or agents arrange transactions in exchange for a commission. Insurance companies often sell through a network of brokers or agents who build relationships directly with customers. If the broker or agent represents a number of different insurance providers, they are considered independent.

Retailers. Retailers sell goods to the public, often in small quantities. Condiment manufacturers typically sell through grocery stores or online retailers, not direct to consumer.















                        Benefits of a channel sales model
                    





Indirect selling happens across an array of industries, and often goes by different names.

Bigger network. Partners can introduce your brand to customers who aren’t in your existing circles and help you scale up sales faster than you could on your own.

Access to new markets. Partners who know a specific niche or geographic area can help you expand into those areas.

Built-in trust. When customers already know and trust your partner, the partner’s credibility benefits you, too.

Amplified reach. Partners can magnify your marketing efforts with their own by hosting local events, driving webinar registrations, or providing onsite training with customers.

Lower overhead. Indirect selling doesn’t involve a lot of the expenses you’d incur from direct selling, such as employee salaries, health insurance, office space, and mileage, because partners are not your employees.

Customer satisfaction. Partnerships can round out your solution with complementary products or services. If your customers prefer to buy one complete experience, indirect selling allows you to better serve how they want to buy — without having to build it all yourself.















                        Drawbacks of a channel sales model — and how to counteract them
                    






Less control over customer experience. The partner represents your brand to the end customer, but you don’t control their interactions with customers. Still, when you provide an excellent partner experience, that often translates into an excellent customer experience, too.

Less knowledge about customers. With indirect selling, the partner doesn’t always tell you who’s actually buying. One way around this is to use product registration. As soon as the end customer registers the product, it creates a direct connection between you and the customer. That way you can survey the customer to uncover unmet needs and ensure the partner provides a quality experience.
Potential conflicts. When you use a hybrid of direct and indirect selling, sometimes your partners may feel like they’re competing with your own salespeople. Creating clear guidelines around what products are sold through the channel versus direct sales can minimize this issue.

	Your channel strategy should align to your company’s overall sales strategy. Start by defining your program’s purpose. This could be a mission statement that outlines what the program offers to partners and what you will do for them and with them. For example, you might say:



“Our partner program is designed to offer resellers and distributors the support and solution expertise they need at every step. We aim to provide our diverse partner network with the tools, technology, and personalized resources they rely on to better serve their customers, build loyalty, and accelerate revenue growth.”



You can display this statement on the public landing page of your partner portal so that potential partners understand what you’re all about. This statement should also guide decisions as the program grows.
Next, define goals for your channel sales program and consider the following:

Set realistic joint expectations between direct and indirect sales teams

Outline sales and co-marketing activities and expected pipeline results with partners

Define target market and product/solution offerings

Create rules of engagement, especially if the partners sell competitors’ products, too

Establish key performance indicators to track progress

	Spend time in vetting, qualifying, and understanding partners. The wrong partners will consume valuable time and resources. Focus on quality over quantity, stresses sales growth and innovation expert Tiffani Bova. Get more tips from Tiffani below. 














                        Invest in enablement and training
                    





	Develop comprehensive training programs so that partners know your products inside and out. Always be ready to answer their questions. 














                        Create clear policies and guidelines
                    





	If your policies and guidelines create confusion or leave room for interpretation, that can create problems. Make sure these documents are as clear and thorough as possible. 














                        Nurture partners’ growth
                    





	Get to know their business goals. How will you support their business objectives?














                        Develop partner relationships
                    





Partners are an extension of your business. Your channel strategy should focus on relationships rather than being merely transactional. Collaborate with partners using an online portal. Ideally, companies should involve partners in decisions on what products or services to offer via the channel, too.

















Salesforce's Kori O'Brien, SVP Alliances & Channels, and Tiffani Bova, Customer Growth and Innovation Evangelist, answer top questions about channel sales in the video above.

	When structuring your channel sales partnerships, first determine what type of partner(s) you need based on your goals. Here are some common goals.








                        Partners for sales reach
                    





	Maybe you don’t have enough salespeople in a particular market or a region. Perhaps you want to break into a new vertical or industry. You’d want to find partners who have an existing reach in the market or industry you’re targeting.














                        Partners for delivery and implementation
                    





	Are you expecting accelerated growth or an uptick in demand? You might not have the manpower to deliver and implement at a faster pace, but partners could. Of course, you still have to get them recruited, trained, and certified, which doesn’t happen overnight. But looking ahead can help you anticipate this need.














                        Partners for solutions, support, and maintenance
                    





	Your product may do A and B, but the customer actually needs the solution to do A, B, and C. Partnering with another company that can actually deliver that third customer requirement allows you to meet this need more quickly than delivering that capability yourself. This can also extend to support and maintenance of your product or service.











            
                Consider these questions before connecting with partners 
            
            
            
            
        



	Get clarity on these key areas before contacting potential partners or inviting them to contact you.








                        What can you offer potential partners?
                    





	Your partners will want to know what type of support you intend to provide, such as comprehensive training, access to sales and marketing tools, technical resources, a dedicated account manager, incentives, and rewards.














                        What’s your value proposition to them?
                    





Here’s your chance to convey the value of the opportunity. Why would a partner choose to do business with you? You might position your program as simple, lucrative, collaborative, or in high demand from their own customers.














                        What are your expectations of them?
                    





	Understand what type of commitment you’re seeking from partners. Consider both partner engagement and partner performance indicators, like completion of training or certification, leads generated or converted, and total revenue brought in.











            
                Recruit channel sales partners 
            
            
            
            
        



	Once you’ve outlined your goals for partnering and structured your program accordingly, you can develop a short list of prospective partners by industry, geography, technical capabilities, and other factors. Make sure you pick the right partner based on capabilities, culture, and willingness to engage with you. The largest company isn’t always your best partner.








                        Inbound recruitment
                    





	Inbound recruitment happens when potential partners come to you. For instance, you can set up a form on your website where potential partners can express interest in selling your products. Then, someone inside your company can vet the application and determine if the partner is a good fit. This can be a cost-effective way to grow your partner network, but you may need to supplement this with outbound recruitment to attract the right partners for your needs.














                        Outbound recruitment
                    





Identifying and contacting partners proactively rather than waiting for them to contact you is another option. For instance, many vendors rely on events like trade shows to highlight their solutions and attract prospective partners. These initiatives can be time-consuming and costly, but may be effective in helping you find the ideal partners.











            
                Hire a channel sales team 
            
            
            
            
        



	Your channel sales program needs dedicated staff to support it and your partners. Depending on the size of your company, these positions may be spread across many or few individuals. Here are some of the key roles and responsibilities you’ll want to think about covering — along with key skills required for each.








                        Channel sales leader
                    





	Channel sales leaders are responsible for meeting partner revenue targets and overseeing a healthy sales funnel. They direct and oversee their organization’s channel sales strategy, policies, and initiatives. Besides needing a solid grasp of the indirect selling motion and partner ecosystem, channel sales leaders require strong business acumen and financial knowledge.














                        Channel account manager (CAM) or partner account manager (PAM)
                    





CAMs are on the front lines and own the relationships with partners, from onboarding to providing sales resources and support. CAMs are responsible for working with partners to build pipeline, so the ability to coach and motivate is critical. Ideally, CAMs will have experience as a reseller or channel partner, so they’ve been on the receiving end of vendor pitches, according to channel sales leader Marcus Cauchi.














                        Channel marketing manager
                    





	Channel marketers must be able to run two distinct types of marketing: In to-partner marketing, you engage current and prospective partners and communicate the value of doing business with you. In through-partner marketing, you’re creating materials and campaigns that partners use to market directly to your end customers. Channel marketers must be very clear on the value proposition of your products and services and how to position them effectively.














                        Channel operations or portal manager
                    





	Also sometimes described as partner program management, channel operations involves helping partners become productive and successful by building out scalable tools and processes. One important responsibility includes designing and managing the partner portal, where partners log in to access resources and workflows. Here, a focus on operational excellence, efficiency, and user experience is particularly useful.











            
                Onboard new channel sales partners 
            
            
            
            
        



Remember that while new partners likely have industry experience, they may not know your product inside and out or understand how to make it relevant for each region, industry, or persona. That’s why partner onboarding is so important.

Onboarding also gives partners a first impression of your business and how easy it is to work together. Don’t wait for partners to request materials. Instead, guide partners through a step-by-step process and offer thorough training on sales must-knows, helping them ramp up more quickly. Investing in onboarding can pay off in future sales and long-term relationships with partners.
At a minimum, your onboarding program should get partners up to speed on the following:

Products and features
Pricing structures
Selling processes
Goals of the partnership


Personalize the partner experience with relevant content and recommendations. Onboarding should be trackable so you can see a partner’s progress over time. If a partner plans to sell one specific product, don’t overwhelm them with specs on other products that aren’t suitable for them.

                Support your channel partners 
            
            
            
            
        



	You’ve brought new partners up to speed and they’re off to the races. Now what? Partners need ongoing support throughout their involvement with your company. Below are some ways to show your support and set partners up for success.








                        Provide instant access to resources
                    





	In addition to onboarding materials, partners need just-in-time information to help them address specific customer issues. Partners may need access to product specs, marketing assets, pitch decks, or more. Making these resources available on demand empowers partners to be more productive and reduces the back-and-forth with internal channel managers.














                        Offer omni-channel support and peer groups
                    





	Be sure partners have chat, email, or phone support for when questions arise. You can also consider offering a B2B social media community for partners, where they can find applicable success stories, ask questions of each other, and share best practices. This peer-to-peer community is potentially worldwide and always open 24 hours a day, which makes it more scalable than providing one-to-one partner support alone.














                        Offer market development funds
                    





Market development funds (MDF) are discretionary monies vendors give to partners to execute marketing initiatives and generate future sales. Some vendors are very specific about how MDF can be used, while others give partners more latitude to spend it how they choose.














                        Provide prepackaged campaigns
                    





	Some partners don’t have a dedicated marketing department or resources, so offering them prebuilt campaigns, trade shows in a box, or brandable content makes it easier for them to market your offering. The other big benefit is that they’ll have professional-looking materials that align with your brand guidelines and standards.











            
                Build strong relationships with channel partners  
            
            
            
            
        



	Recruiting, onboarding, and supporting channel sales partners takes valuable time, money, and other resources. It’s a win-win for everyone when you foster meaningful, long-term relationships with partners. Here’s how to do that.








                        Launch a partner advisory board
                    





	Give select partners an active voice in your strategy. Create a board — either formally or informally — that you can tap into for feedback, ideas, and pilot testing new programs and technologies. You can even seek their input on the development of upcoming products based on what they’re hearing from customers.














                        Create a joint business plan
                    





Keep partners — and yourself — accountable by aligning on yearly business plans. Set goals for each quarter and check back in with each other at a regular cadence to ensure both sides are delivering on their promises and collaborating effectively.














                        Co-invest in sales reps
                    





Channel partners always want more salespeople, but those cost money. Your company could co-sponsor or co-invest in dedicated sales reps at your partner’s company. This can be very attractive to the partner, and give you reps who are very interested in your own product. You could stipulate that by paying for 50% or 75% of the rep, they will attend your training school or call X number of new leads per day.














                        Take responsibility for issues
                    





When end customers have an issue with a partner, they often complain to the vendor. When that happens, do not throw partners under the bus, even if they were at fault. Instead, apologize to the customer and work with the partner to make things right. Customers expect partners to be an extension of your business, so working with the partner to resolve issues reflects positively on both of you.











            
                Motivate channel sales partners  
            
            
            
            
        



	Most partners work with multiple vendors. They might carry dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of different vendors’ products and services — including your competitors’. That means you want to stay top of mind with partners and motivate them to sell your products.








                        Create a tiered incentive program
                    





	Salespeople tend to be driven and competitive, so creating performance levels for partners to attain can keep them engaged with your brand and excited to level up. Be transparent about the benefits of each level, such as better margins or other incentives. Use charts and dashboards so partners can monitor their progress and tap into their competitive spirit.














                        Celebrate partner success
                    





	Highlight both the big accomplishments and small wins of a variety of partners. Whether a mention in an email newsletter, a banner in your partner portal, or a speech at a partner summit, these shoutouts will make your partners feel proud and valued. Plus, the rest of your partners will be eager to see their own name in lights.














                        Know when to fold
                    





	Engaged and motivated partners can be your allies in selling. If you’ve provided onboarding and enablement resources, but the partner just isn’t engaged, it may be time to part ways. Do not allow a partner mismatch in expectations or engagement to suck up valuable time and resources you could be investing in more suitable partners.











            
                Measure your channel sales programs 
            
            
            
            
        



As the old adage goes, “you can’t manage what you can’t measure.” Measuring channel sales performance is key so that you and your partners know how they are doing, and you can make informed decisions to improve the business.
You might use metrics to identify your most strategic partners, so you know where to invest your resources. Your partners might use analytics to discuss where they need more support or training, or to benchmark where they stand against other partners.
Consider tracking and sharing these partner success metrics:

Partner pipeline for the year
Partner pipeline for the quarter
Total revenue driven
Partner leadership scoreboards
Total marketing funds used for ROI









	Remember, channel goals should be individualized to each partner and where they are in the enablement journey. They should also be tied to your own business goals.





            
                Conclusion 
            
            
            
            
        



	An effective channel sales program helps vendors, partners, and customers. By thinking through each step of the process — from recruiting to onboarding, all the way to managing and motivating partners — vendors can reap the long-term benefits of indirect selling.

Channel sales — or selling through partners — represents 75% of the world’s commerce, according to Forrester. This approach helps companies accelerate sales and grow revenue without adding to their headcount, a move that’s increasingly important during economic uncertainty.Whether you’re launching a channel to scale more efficiently, tap into new markets, or meet customer needs, this guide can help. In it, you’ll learn the basics of channel sales and how it can work for you. For those already well versed in working with partners, feel free to skip ahead to the sections most helpful to you.

These intermediaries go by many names in different contexts: partners, resellers, dealers, distributors, brokers, agents, affiliates — the list goes on. This business model is also called indirect selling, because the company doesn’t have a direct connection to the end customer. What is the difference between channel sales and direct sales? While indirect sales uses a go-between, direct selling does not. Under a direct sales model, the brand sells straight to the end consumer. For instance, a brand might sell through its own retail store or its own website.Many companies use a mix of direct and indirect sales. They may have customers who prefer buying through a channel (for example, a third-party retail store), while other customers might prefer buying from the manufacturer. Below are a few examples to help illustrate this point.                            Direct sales: Sales where the company sells directly to the end customer.                                                                                     Indirect sales: Sales that use an intermediary such as partners, resellers, dealers, or brokers. Also called channel sales.                                                                                 Examples of channel sales                    Indirect selling happens across an array of industries, and often goes by different names. Affiliates. Affiliates are websites that get paid a commission to send customers to a merchant’s website. A makeup brand might use beauty bloggers or social influencers as affiliates to promote its lip gloss and bronzers online.Alliances. Alliances are partnerships with companies that sell complementary products. For instance, a cloud software company might provide enterprise storage in partnership with another tech company.Dealers. Dealers serve as an intermediary between customers and the manufacturer. Car manufacturers sell through dealerships.Distributors. Distributors buy directly from the businesses, then market and sell to customers in their operating regions. For instance, a beverage manufacturer sells directly to distributors, who then sell those products to stores and restaurants in a specific geographic area.Franchisees. Franchisees pay to use a brand’s identity, processes, and business model to sell that brand’s products or services. Some gyms license their brand to independently owned and operated franchise locations.Resellers or s. Resellers or value-added resellers (s) purchase existing products with the intention of reselling them, often adding features or services to enhance value. Many software companies sell through resellers or s.Independent brokers or agents. Brokers or agents arrange transactions in exchange for a commission. Insurance companies often sell through a network of brokers or agents who build relationships directly with customers. If the broker or agent represents a number of different insurance providers, they are considered independent.Retailers. Retailers sell goods to the public, often in small quantities. Condiment manufacturers typically sell through grocery stores or online retailers, not direct to consumer.                        Benefits of a channel sales model                    Indirect selling happens across an array of industries, and often goes by different names.Bigger network. Partners can introduce your brand to customers who aren’t in your existing circles and help you scale up sales faster than you could on your own.Access to new markets. Partners who know a specific niche or geographic area can help you expand into those areas.Built-in trust. When customers already know and trust your partner, the partner’s credibility benefits you, too.Amplified reach. Partners can magnify your marketing efforts with their own by hosting local events, driving webinar registrations, or providing onsite training with customers.Lower overhead. Indirect selling doesn’t involve a lot of the expenses you’d incur from direct selling, such as employee salaries, health insurance, office space, and mileage, because partners are not your employees.Customer satisfaction. Partnerships can round out your solution with complementary products or services. If your customers prefer to buy one complete experience, indirect selling allows you to better serve how they want to buy — without having to build it all yourself.                        Drawbacks of a channel sales model — and how to counteract them                    Less control over customer experience. The partner represents your brand to the end customer, but you don’t control their interactions with customers. Still, when you provide an excellent partner experience, that often translates into an excellent customer experience, too.Less knowledge about customers. With indirect selling, the partner doesn’t always tell you who’s actually buying. One way around this is to use product registration. As soon as the end customer registers the product, it creates a direct connection between you and the customer. That way you can survey the customer to uncover unmet needs and ensure the partner provides a quality experience.Potential conflicts. When you use a hybrid of direct and indirect selling, sometimes your partners may feel like they’re competing with your own salespeople. Creating clear guidelines around what products are sold through the channel versus direct sales can minimize this issue.                            Develop a channel sales strategy                                                         	Your channel strategy should align to your company’s overall sales strategy. Start by defining your program’s purpose. This could be a mission statement that outlines what the program offers to partners and what you will do for them and with them. For example, you might say:“Our partner program is designed to offer resellers and distributors the support and solution expertise they need at every step. We aim to provide our diverse partner network with the tools, technology, and personalized resources they rely on to better serve their customers, build loyalty, and accelerate revenue growth.”You can display this statement on the public landing page of your partner portal so that potential partners understand what you’re all about. This statement should also guide decisions as the program grows.Next, define goals for your channel sales program and consider the following:Set realistic joint expectations between direct and indirect sales teamsOutline sales and co-marketing activities and expected pipeline results with partnersDefine target market and product/solution offeringsCreate rules of engagement, especially if the partners sell competitors’ products, tooEstablish key performance indicators to track progressWell-defined goals propel channel sales, create better partner alignment, and ensure a flourishing relationship between vendors and partners.

The wrong partners will consume valuable time and resources. Focus on quality over quantity, stresses sales growth and innovation expert Tiffani Bova. Get more tips from Tiffani below.                         Invest in enablement and training                    	Develop comprehensive training programs so that partners know your products inside and out. Always be ready to answer their questions.                         Create clear policies and guidelines                    	If your policies and guidelines create confusion or leave room for interpretation, that can create problems. Make sure these documents are as clear and thorough as possible.                         Nurture partners’ growth                    	Get to know their business goals. How will you support their business objectives?                        Develop partner relationships                    Partners are an extension of your business. Your channel strategy should focus on relationships rather than being merely transactional. Collaborate with partners using an online portal. Ideally, companies should involve partners in decisions on what products or services to offer via the channel, too.Salesforce's Kori O'Brien,  Alliances & Channels, and Tiffani Bova, Customer Growth and Innovation Evangelist, answer top questions about channel sales in the video above.                            Design your channel partner program                                                         	When structuring your channel sales partnerships, first determine what type of partner(s) you need based on your goals. Here are some common goals.                        Partners for sales reach                    	Maybe you don’t have enough salespeople in a particular market or a region. Perhaps you want to break into a new vertical or industry. You’d want to find partners who have an existing reach in the market or industry you’re targeting.                        Partners for delivery and implementation                    	Are you expecting accelerated growth or an uptick in demand? You might not have the manpower to deliver and implement at a faster pace, but partners could. Of course, you still have to get them recruited, trained, and certified, which doesn’t happen overnight. But looking ahead can help you anticipate this need.                        Partners for solutions, support, and maintenance                    	Your product may do A and B, but the customer actually needs the solution to do A, B, and C. Partnering with another company that can actually deliver that third customer requirement allows you to meet this need more quickly than delivering that capability yourself. This can also extend to support and maintenance of your product or service.                            Consider these questions before connecting with partners                                                         	Get clarity on these key areas before contacting potential partners or inviting them to contact you.                        What can you offer potential partners?                    	Your partners will want to know what type of support you intend to provide, such as comprehensive training, access to sales and marketing tools, technical resources, a dedicated account manager, incentives, and rewards.                        What’s your value proposition to them?                    Here’s your chance to convey the value of the opportunity. Why would a partner choose to do business with you? You might position your program as simple, lucrative, collaborative, or in high demand from their own customers.                        What are your expectations of them?                    	Understand what type of commitment you’re seeking from partners. Consider both partner engagement and partner performance indicators, like completion of training or certification, leads generated or converted, and total revenue brought in.                            Recruit channel sales partners                                                         	Once you’ve outlined your goals for partnering and structured your program accordingly, you can develop a short list of prospective partners by industry, geography, technical capabilities, and other factors. Make sure you pick the right partner based on capabilities, culture, and willingness to engage with you. The largest company isn’t always your best partner.                        Inbound recruitment                    	Inbound recruitment happens when potential partners come to you. For instance, you can set up a form on your website where potential partners can express interest in selling your products. Then, someone inside your company can vet the application and determine if the partner is a good fit. This can be a cost-effective way to grow your partner network, but you may need to supplement this with outbound recruitment to attract the right partners for your needs.                        Outbound recruitment                    Identifying and contacting partners proactively rather than waiting for them to contact you is another option. For instance, many vendors rely on events like trade shows to highlight their solutions and attract prospective partners. These initiatives can be time-consuming and costly, but may be effective in helping you find the ideal partners.                            Hire a channel sales team                                                         	Your channel sales program needs dedicated staff to support it and your partners. Depending on the size of your company, these positions may be spread across many or few individuals. Here are some of the key roles and responsibilities you’ll want to think about covering — along with key skills required for each.                        Channel sales leader                    	Channel sales leaders are responsible for meeting partner revenue targets and overseeing a healthy sales funnel. They direct and oversee their organization’s channel sales strategy, policies, and initiatives. Besides needing a solid grasp of the indirect selling motion and partner ecosystem, channel sales leaders require strong business acumen and financial knowledge.                        Channel account manager () or partner account manager ()                    s are on the front lines and own the relationships with partners, from onboarding to providing sales resources and support. s are responsible for working with partners to build pipeline, so the ability to coach and motivate is critical. Ideally, s will have experience as a reseller or channel partner, so they’ve been on the receiving end of vendor pitches, according to channel sales leader Marcus Cauchi.                        Channel marketing manager                    	Channel marketers must be able to run two distinct types of marketing: In to-partner marketing, you engage current and prospective partners and communicate the value of doing business with you. In through-partner marketing, you’re creating materials and campaigns that partners use to market directly to your end customers. Channel marketers must be very clear on the value proposition of your products and services and how to position them effectively.                        Channel operations or portal manager                    	Also sometimes described as partner program management, channel operations involves helping partners become productive and successful by building out scalable tools and processes. One important responsibility includes designing and managing the partner portal, where partners log in to access resources and workflows. Here, a focus on operational excellence, efficiency, and user experience is particularly useful.                            Onboard new channel sales partners                                                         Remember that while new partners likely have industry experience, they may not know your product inside and out or understand how to make it relevant for each region, industry, or persona. That’s why partner onboarding is so important.Onboarding also gives partners a first impression of your business and how easy it is to work together. Don’t wait for partners to request materials. Instead, guide partners through a step-by-step process and offer thorough training on sales must-knows, helping them ramp up more quickly. Investing in onboarding can pay off in future sales and long-term relationships with partners.At a minimum, your onboarding program should get partners up to speed on the following:Products and featuresPricing structuresSelling processesGoals of the partnershipPersonalize the partner experience with relevant content and recommendations. Onboarding should be trackable so you can see a partner’s progress over time. If a partner plans to sell one specific product, don’t overwhelm them with specs on other products that aren’t suitable for them.For more about onboarding partners and personalizing the partner experience, check out this Trailhead module.                            Support your channel partners                                                         	You’ve brought new partners up to speed and they’re off to the races. Now what? Partners need ongoing support throughout their involvement with your company. Below are some ways to show your support and set partners up for success.                        Provide instant access to resources                    	In addition to onboarding materials, partners need just-in-time information to help them address specific customer issues. Partners may need access to product specs, marketing assets, pitch decks, or more. Making these resources available on demand empowers partners to be more productive and reduces the back-and-forth with internal channel managers.                        Offer omni-channel support and peer groups                    	Be sure partners have chat, email, or phone support for when questions arise. You can also consider offering a B2B social media community for partners, where they can find applicable success stories, ask questions of each other, and share best practices. This peer-to-peer community is potentially worldwide and always open 24 hours a day, which makes it more scalable than providing one-to-one partner support alone.                        Offer market development funds                    Market development funds () are discretionary monies vendors give to partners to execute marketing initiatives and generate future sales. Some vendors are very specific about how  can be used, while others give partners more latitude to spend it how they choose.                        Provide prepackaged campaigns                    	Some partners don’t have a dedicated marketing department or resources, so offering them prebuilt campaigns, trade shows in a box, or brandable content makes it easier for them to market your offering. The other big benefit is that they’ll have professional-looking materials that align with your brand guidelines and standards.                            Build strong relationships with channel partners                                                          	Recruiting, onboarding, and supporting channel sales partners takes valuable time, money, and other resources. It’s a win-win for everyone when you foster meaningful, long-term relationships with partners. Here’s how to do that.                        Launch a partner advisory board                    	Give select partners an active voice in your strategy. Create a board — either formally or informally — that you can tap into for feedback, ideas, and pilot testing new programs and technologies. You can even seek their input on the development of upcoming products based on what they’re hearing from customers.                        Create a joint business plan                    Keep partners — and yourself — accountable by aligning on yearly business plans. Set goals for each quarter and check back in with each other at a regular cadence to ensure both sides are delivering on their promises and collaborating effectively.                        Co-invest in sales reps                    Channel partners always want more salespeople, but those cost money. Your company could co-sponsor or co-invest in dedicated sales reps at your partner’s company. This can be very attractive to the partner, and give you reps who are very interested in your own product. You could stipulate that by paying for 50% or 75% of the rep, they will attend your training school or call X number of new leads per day.                        Take responsibility for issues                    When end customers have an issue with a partner, they often complain to the vendor. When that happens, do not throw partners under the bus, even if they were at fault. Instead, apologize to the customer and work with the partner to make things right. Customers expect partners to be an extension of your business, so working with the partner to resolve issues reflects positively on both of you.                            Motivate channel sales partners                                                          	Most partners work with multiple vendors. They might carry dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of different vendors’ products and services — including your competitors’. That means you want to stay top of mind with partners and motivate them to sell your products.                        Create a tiered incentive program                    	Salespeople tend to be driven and competitive, so creating performance levels for partners to attain can keep them engaged with your brand and excited to level up. Be transparent about the benefits of each level, such as better margins or other incentives. Use charts and dashboards so partners can monitor their progress and tap into their competitive spirit.                        Celebrate partner success                    	Highlight both the big accomplishments and small wins of a variety of partners. Whether a mention in an email newsletter, a banner in your partner portal, or a speech at a partner summit, these shoutouts will make your partners feel proud and valued. Plus, the rest of your partners will be eager to see their own name in lights.                        Know when to fold                    	Engaged and motivated partners can be your allies in selling. If you’ve provided onboarding and enablement resources, but the partner just isn’t engaged, it may be time to part ways. Do not allow a partner mismatch in expectations or engagement to suck up valuable time and resources you could be investing in more suitable partners.                            Measure your channel sales programs                                                         As the old adage goes, “you can’t manage what you can’t measure.” Measuring channel sales performance is key so that you and your partners know how they are doing, and you can make informed decisions to improve the business.You might use metrics to identify your most strategic partners, so you know where to invest your resources. Your partners might use analytics to discuss where they need more support or training, or to benchmark where they stand against other partners.Consider tracking and sharing these partner success metrics:Partner pipeline for the yearPartner pipeline for the quarterTotal revenue drivenPartner leadership scoreboardsTotal marketing funds used for 	Remember, channel goals should be individualized to each partner and where they are in the enablement journey. They should also be tied to your own business goals.

Channel sales — or selling through partners — represents 75% of the world’s commerce, according to Forrester. This approach helps companies accelerate sales and grow revenue without adding to their headcount, a move that’s increasingly important during economic uncertainty.Whether you’re launching a channel to scale more efficiently, tap into new markets, or meet customer needs, this guide can help. In it, you’ll learn the basics of channel sales and how it can work for you. Navigate this guide                                                         Understand channel salesDevelop a channel sales strategyImplement a channel sales modelDesign your channel partner programConsider these questions before connecting with partnersRecruit channel sales partnersHire a channel sales teamOnboard new channel sales partnersSupport your channel partnersBuild strong relationships with channel partnersMotivate channel sales partnersMeasure your channel sales programs                            Understand channel sales                                                         What is channel sales?In channel sales, companies (here we’ll call them vendors) sell through intermediaries. These intermediaries go by many names in different contexts: partners, resellers, dealers, distributors, brokers, agents, affiliates — the list goes on. This business model is also called indirect selling, because the company doesn’t have a direct connection to the end customer. They may have customers who prefer buying through a channel (for example, a third-party retail store), while other customers might prefer buying from the manufacturer. Indirect sales: Sales that use an intermediary such as partners, resellers, dealers, or brokers. Examples of channel sales                    Indirect selling happens across an array of industries, and often goes by different names. For instance, a cloud software company might provide enterprise storage in partnership with another tech company.Dealers. Some gyms license their brand to independently owned and operated franchise locations.Resellers or s. Resellers or value-added resellers (s) purchase existing products with the intention of reselling them, often adding features or services to enhance value. Benefits of a channel sales model                    Indirect selling happens across an array of industries, and often goes by different names.Bigger network. Partners can introduce your brand to customers who aren’t in your existing circles and help you scale up sales faster than you could on your own.Access to new markets. Partners can magnify your marketing efforts with their own by hosting local events, driving webinar registrations, or providing onsite training with customers.Lower overhead. Indirect selling doesn’t involve a lot of the expenses you’d incur from direct selling, such as employee salaries, health insurance, office space, and mileage, because partners are not your employees.Customer satisfaction. With indirect selling, the partner doesn’t always tell you who’s actually buying. When you use a hybrid of direct and indirect selling, sometimes your partners may feel like they’re competing with your own salespeople. We aim to provide our diverse partner network with the tools, technology, and personalized resources they rely on to better serve their customers, build loyalty, and accelerate revenue growth.”You can display this statement on the public landing page of your partner portal so that potential partners understand what you’re all about. This statement should also guide decisions as the program grows.Next, define goals for your channel sales program and consider the following:Set realistic joint expectations between direct and indirect sales teamsOutline sales and co-marketing activities and expected pipeline results with partnersDefine target market and product/solution offeringsCreate rules of engagement, especially if the partners sell competitors’ products, tooEstablish key performance indicators to track progressWell-defined goals propel channel sales, create better partner alignment, and ensure a flourishing relationship between vendors and partners. Implement a channel sales model                                                                                 Find the right match                    	Spend time in vetting, qualifying, and understanding partners. Ideally, companies should involve partners in decisions on what products or services to offer via the channel, too.Salesforce's Kori O'Brien,  Alliances & Channels, and Tiffani Bova, Customer Growth and Innovation Evangelist, answer top questions about channel sales in the video above. Design your channel partner program                                                         	When structuring your channel sales partnerships, first determine what type of partner(s) you need based on your goals. Partners for solutions, support, and maintenance                    	Your product may do A and B, but the customer actually needs the solution to do A, B, and C. Partnering with another company that can actually deliver that third customer requirement allows you to meet this need more quickly than delivering that capability yourself. Your partners will want to know what type of support you intend to provide, such as comprehensive training, access to sales and marketing tools, technical resources, a dedicated account manager, incentives, and rewards. Recruit channel sales partners                                                         	Once you’ve outlined your goals for partnering and structured your program accordingly, you can develop a short list of prospective partners by industry, geography, technical capabilities, and other factors. For instance, you can set up a form on your website where potential partners can express interest in selling your products. This can be a cost-effective way to grow your partner network, but you may need to supplement this with outbound recruitment to attract the right partners for your needs. For instance, many vendors rely on events like trade shows to highlight their solutions and attract prospective partners. These initiatives can be time-consuming and costly, but may be effective in helping you find the ideal partners. They direct and oversee their organization’s channel sales strategy, policies, and initiatives. Besides needing a solid grasp of the indirect selling motion and partner ecosystem, channel sales leaders require strong business acumen and financial knowledge. Channel account manager () or partner account manager ()                    s are on the front lines and own the relationships with partners, from onboarding to providing sales resources and support. Ideally, s will have experience as a reseller or channel partner, so they’ve been on the receiving end of vendor pitches, according to channel sales leader Marcus Cauchi. Channel marketing manager                    	Channel marketers must be able to run two distinct types of marketing: In to-partner marketing, you engage current and prospective partners and communicate the value of doing business with you. In through-partner marketing, you’re creating materials and campaigns that partners use to market directly to your end customers. Channel operations or portal manager                    	Also sometimes described as partner program management, channel operations involves helping partners become productive and successful by building out scalable tools and processes. One important responsibility includes designing and managing the partner portal, where partners log in to access resources and workflows. Onboard new channel sales partners                                                         Remember that while new partners likely have industry experience, they may not know your product inside and out or understand how to make it relevant for each region, industry, or persona. Instead, guide partners through a step-by-step process and offer thorough training on sales must-knows, helping them ramp up more quickly. Investing in onboarding can pay off in future sales and long-term relationships with partners.At a minimum, your onboarding program should get partners up to speed on the following:Products and featuresPricing structuresSelling processesGoals of the partnershipPersonalize the partner experience with relevant content and recommendations. If a partner plans to sell one specific product, don’t overwhelm them with specs on other products that aren’t suitable for them.For more about onboarding partners and personalizing the partner experience, check out this Trailhead module. Provide instant access to resources                    	In addition to onboarding materials, partners need just-in-time information to help them address specific customer issues. Partners may need access to product specs, marketing assets, pitch decks, or more. Offer omni-channel support and peer groups                    	Be sure partners have chat, email, or phone support for when questions arise. You can also consider offering a B2B social media community for partners, where they can find applicable success stories, ask questions of each other, and share best practices. Some vendors are very specific about how  can be used, while others give partners more latitude to spend it how they choose. Provide prepackaged campaigns                    	Some partners don’t have a dedicated marketing department or resources, so offering them prebuilt campaigns, trade shows in a box, or brandable content makes it easier for them to market your offering. Build strong relationships with channel partners                                                          	Recruiting, onboarding, and supporting channel sales partners takes valuable time, money, and other resources. It’s a win-win for everyone when you foster meaningful, long-term relationships with partners. Co-invest in sales reps                    Channel partners always want more salespeople, but those cost money. Customers expect partners to be an extension of your business, so working with the partner to resolve issues reflects positively on both of you. Create a tiered incentive program                    	Salespeople tend to be driven and competitive, so creating performance levels for partners to attain can keep them engaged with your brand and excited to level up. Whether a mention in an email newsletter, a banner in your partner portal, or a speech at a partner summit, these shoutouts will make your partners feel proud and valued. If you’ve provided onboarding and enablement resources, but the partner just isn’t engaged, it may be time to part ways. Measure your channel sales programs                                                         As the old adage goes, “you can’t manage what you can’t measure.” Measuring channel sales performance is key so that you and your partners know how they are doing, and you can make informed decisions to improve the business.You might use metrics to identify your most strategic partners, so you know where to invest your resources. Your partners might use analytics to discuss where they need more support or training, or to benchmark where they stand against other partners.Consider tracking and sharing these partner success metrics:Partner pipeline for the yearPartner pipeline for the quarterTotal revenue drivenPartner leadership scoreboardsTotal marketing funds used for 	Remember, channel goals should be individualized to each partner and where they are in the enablement journey. Conclusion                                                         	An effective channel sales program helps vendors, partners, and customers. By thinking through each step of the process — from recruiting to onboarding, all the way to managing and motivating partners — vendors can reap the long-term benefits of indirect selling.

PayPal, a Salesforce customer, wrote this article.
When the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic, I was two weeks into my new job at PayPal. As the new head of global sales, my main goal was to give my team everything they needed to help our customers. But, of course, the tactics changed dramatically when the world got hit with a health crisis and our entire staff started working from home. A lot has happened since then, but I keep coming back to one idea: How can I help? How do I help our customers? My employees? My family?
Below are a few new ways I’ve been thinking about sales leadership, along with a few actions I’ve taken to guide our employees and be there for my loved ones. Hopefully, it provides the inspiration you’re looking for as we all continue to grapple with our new normal.
Help customers and the community through their own financial crisis
PayPal has always prided itself on our commitment to our customers. The arrival of the coronavirus has only made that more essential. Whether it’s businesses that have closed their physical doors and need to sell online or consumers who are looking for a secure way to pay, we’re here to help.
Within the first month of the pandemic, we enabled 96% of our workforce to work fully from home, ensuring people could continue to use our service to buy food, pay their workers, donate to relief efforts, and send money to loved ones back home.
Employees are juggling work on top of family, health, and safety. So, now’s the time to listen to what they’re going through and let them know you care.PEGGY ALFORD, EVP, GLOBAL SALES, PAYPAL
We’ve doubled down on our efforts to support small businesses. They’re the foundation of our economy, but most at risk during this time. Many face supply chain challenges. Others don’t have enough capital to survive closures. 
Business owners call our customer service lines, asking how we can help them stay afloat. They’re asking about everything from taking out loans to securing lines of credit for themselves and their customers.
In response, we took several actions to help our merchants access their funds, increase cash flow, expand protections, and defer repayments. These include:
Waiving chargeback fees for merchants if their customer files a dispute with their credit card issuerWaiving fees on instant withdrawal of money from a PayPal business account to a bank account, Mastercard Debit, and Visa Debit cardExpanding the window of time in which merchants must respond if a customer files a chargeback disputeAllowing merchants with existing PayPal Working Capital, PayPal Business Loans, or LoanBuilder loans to request deferred repaymentTemporarily suspending all PayPal Working Capital, PayPal Business Loan, and LoanBuilder repayments for areas that received a Major Disaster Declaration by FEMAWe also launched a website with educational resources to help businesses make the transition online, including insights on maintaining cash flow in the current climate, switching to digital invoicing to save money, and setting payment terms to encourage early payments.
On a consumer level, we leaned into what we’re most known for: paying for online purchases and person-to-person payments. We are covering all transaction fees for donations made to the PayPal Giving Fund to benefit charities. On GivingTuesday alone, we processed a record-breaking $185 million globally for charities such as the American Red Cross, CDC Foundation, World Central Kitchen, and Feeding America.
And we will continue to identify opportunities to do more for all our customers — merchants and consumers — during this difficult period.
Ultimately, this is our time to step up. And it can be yours, too. Think about what your business can offer to help your customers. Is it sharing best practices? Extending payment terms? Or even just listening to what your customers are going through? Every little bit can help build community at a time when many of us may be feeling isolated.
Guide employees through change and work/life balance
In any business, employees are your greatest asset. It’s vital that you take care of them.
At PayPal, we continue to pay employees who can’t work because they’re sick or need to take care of someone who’s sick. We’ve also asked managers to accommodate those with childcare or family care challenges by developing flexible working arrangements to prioritize work/life balance.
I do what I need to do at work, and then I spend time with the kids. It’s not perfect, but I’m trying to be in the moment with the people I love.PEGGY ALFORD, EVP, GLOBAL SALES, PAYPAL
We sent out surveys for employees to share feedback regularly so we can determine what additional measures may be needed during this time. Our senior leadership team meets daily to discuss those results and other top-of-mind issues to make sure our employees get what they need.
“We believe a healthy workforce will deliver a healthy customer experience,” said my colleague, Dan Torunian, vice president of employee technology and experiences at PayPal.
At the end of the day, policy changes and employee outreach can help ease burdens, but they don’t erase the anxiety many of us are feeling. Sometimes that requires a more personal touch.
I’m taking the time to check in more with my sales teams, whether that’s holding staff meetings or personal one-on-ones. Employees are juggling work on top of family, health, and safety. So, now’s the time to listen to what they’re going through and let them know you care.
We show up for family
During the pandemic, I moved. My college kid returned home after classes were canceled. And I’ve got a 7-year-old and 2-year-old running around in sore need of extra attention. Like many other parents, I am homeschooling, too. How am I dealing? I am planning as best I can and trying to keep a positive attitude.
I do what I need to do at work, and then I spend time with the kids. It’s not perfect, but I’m trying to be in the moment with the people I love — whether that’s leaving the phone at home while we go outside for a walk or rescheduling a meeting until after bedtime.
If you’re like me and you’re navigating both career and family, you’ll never feel like you’ve got the balance completely right, but that’s okay. You’re there. And that in itself helps everyone around you.

Charitable Giving, Employee Support, and Boosting Small Business  					Peggy Alford											, Global Sales, Paypal						We’re all doing our best, and PayPal is stepping up. This FinTech is offering flexibility to its business clients, consumer base, and global team – and raising $2 million for better health.Dec 17, 20205 min readPayPal, a Salesforce customer, wrote this article.When the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic, I was two weeks into my new job at PayPal. My family?Below are a few new ways I’ve been thinking about sales leadership, along with a few actions I’ve taken to guide our employees and be there for my loved ones. Hopefully, it provides the inspiration you’re looking for as we all continue to grapple with our new normal.Help customers and the community through their own financial crisisPayPal has always prided itself on our commitment to our customers. Whether it’s businesses that have closed their physical doors and need to sell online or consumers who are looking for a secure way to pay, we’re here to help.Within the first month of the pandemic, we enabled 96% of our workforce to work fully from home, ensuring people could continue to use our service to buy food, pay their workers, donate to relief efforts, and send money to loved ones back home.Employees are juggling work on top of family, health, and safety. They’re asking about everything from taking out loans to securing lines of credit for themselves and their customers.In response, we took several actions to help our merchants access their funds, increase cash flow, expand protections, and defer repayments. These include:Waiving chargeback fees for merchants if their customer files a dispute with their credit card issuerWaiving fees on instant withdrawal of money from a PayPal business account to a bank account, Mastercard Debit, and Visa Debit cardExpanding the window of time in which merchants must respond if a customer files a chargeback disputeAllowing merchants with existing PayPal Working Capital, PayPal Business Loans, or LoanBuilder loans to request deferred repaymentTemporarily suspending all PayPal Working Capital, PayPal Business Loan, and LoanBuilder repayments for areas that received a Major Disaster Declaration by e also launched a website with educational resources to help businesses make the transition online, including insights on maintaining cash flow in the current climate, switching to digital invoicing to save money, and setting payment terms to encourage early payments.On a consumer level, we leaned into what we’re most known for: paying for online purchases and person-to-person payments. On GivingTuesday alone, we processed a record-breaking $185 million globally for charities such as the American Red Cross,  Foundation, World Central Kitchen, and Feeding America.And we will continue to identify opportunities to do more for all our customers — merchants and consumers — during this difficult period.Ultimately, this is our time to step up. Our senior leadership team meets daily to discuss those results and other top-of-mind issues to make sure our employees get what they need.“We believe a healthy workforce will deliver a healthy customer experience,” said my colleague, Dan Torunian, vice president of employee technology and experiences at PayPal.At the end of the day, policy changes and employee outreach can help ease burdens, but they don’t erase the anxiety many of us are feeling. Sometimes that requires a more personal touch.I’m taking the time to check in more with my sales teams, whether that’s holding staff meetings or personal one-on-ones. It’s not perfect, but I’m trying to be in the moment with the people I love — whether that’s leaving the phone at home while we go outside for a walk or rescheduling a meeting until after bedtime.If you’re like me and you’re navigating both career and family, you’ll never feel like you’ve got the balance completely right, but that’s okay.

Is the Head of Sales Job Going Extinct? The Rise of the CROChief revenue officers have a birds-eye view of all revenue activities and are able to identify new sales channels and uncover untapped markets.

Chief revenue officers (CROs) seem to be everywhere these days. Since Forbes dubbed the chief revenue officer a “CEO’s secret weapon” nearly a decade ago, the role has exploded in popularity. A peek at LinkedIn now shows more than 2,000 open job listings for CROs, most of them posted in the last month. Is it another example of C-suite overcrowding? (Anyone remember the chief “listening” officer craze?) Or is it an indispensable miracle function that will superpower your business and propel your revenue to new heights? Let’s dig in.
According to industry analysts at Ventana, almost one-quarter of organizations will establish a chief revenue officer role by 2023. Businesses are realizing that to stay agile, strategic, and most importantly, sustainable, they need a CRO who can fold marketing, sales, and customer success into one seamless revenue machine.
“In the last seven or eight years, we’ve seen a real emphasis on the chief revenue officer,” said Michael Maoz, senior vice president of innovation strategy at Salesforce. “They’re able to pinpoint how organizations can strategically move themselves into a very successful future.”

What does a chief revenue officer do exactly?
Great question. It’s an evolving discussion that comes up with our customers every day. A CRO leads the revenue-generating processes across your entire organization. They see how all departments can drive revenue for the company; those departments can include sales, marketing, customer success, and finance. The CRO leverages cross-functional knowledge to create a complete view of the customer lifecycle from bringing in new leads to closing deals to renewing customer contracts.
“What we learned from recent research is that ‘growth’ has a different definition than it did 10 years ago,” said Karen Semone, vice president of innovation strategy at Salesforce. “Growth isn’t just describing the financial valuation of a business anymore. It’s a broader term, inclusive of growing talent, market share, brand relevance. The evolving role of the CRO considers this more holistic definition of growth.”

Alignment is the name of the game, as CROs rip down silos to gain full visibility into every part of the business. With a birds-eye view of all revenue activities, they’re able to identify new sales channels, uncover untapped markets, and take advantage of other previously unknown revenue opportunities. They’re able to scale operations to maximize revenue.
Although the CRO often has a background in sales, the role should not be confused with the vice president of sales.
We’re seeing this CRO role now because we’re starting to think about revenue as more of a continuum rather than just sales bringing in revenue.Asia corbett, head of revenue and community operations at revgenius
“There’s a perception that a good CRO is the best salesperson in the room,” said Timothy O’Neil, the chief revenue officer at Alation, the leader in enterprise data intelligence solutions. “As a CRO at a scaling company, you have to focus more on the strategy and methodologies than the day-to-day deals.”
It’s a big job with plenty of responsibility. Although the tasks may vary day to day, they might look something like this:
Establishing a go-to-market strategy and defining revenue goals/metricsRecruiting, retaining, and training the best talentDiving deep into data analysis with revenue, pipelines, and forecastsAcquiring and deploying the right sales tools for efficiency and effectivenessFostering senior-level client relationships and influencing deal structureIncorporating customer feedback into the product development cycle
Having one person who’s accountable for alignment among all the revenue-related departments pays off. According to Forrester, companies that aligned people, processes, and technology across their sales and marketing teams achieved 36% more revenue growth and up to 28% more profitability.
“The CRO is thinking way ahead. They’re thinking about renewals, and how to ensure that revenue continues to exist and persist beyond this quarter. There’s a wider lens around bringing the voice of the customer into all parts of the organization,” said Adnan Chaudhry, head of Americas sales at Slack.

Why are chief revenue officers surging in popularity?
Short answer: 2020 happened.
In many ways, the pandemic showed the urgent need for organizations to possess agility, resilience, and an unshakeable long-term mindset. Silos evaporated as sales, marketing, and customer success had to come together as one to make decisions that would ensure survival.
“We’re seeing this CRO role now because we’re starting to think about revenue as more of a continuum rather than just sales bringing in revenue,” said Asia Corbett, head of revenue and community operations at RevGenuis, a network for revenue professionals. “You need somebody at the top who is looking at the strategy over the whole buyer’s journey and not just focused on sales.”
Companies need to think across three years, five years, 10 years, a generation. So they bring in a chief revenue officer.Michael Maoz, senior vp of Innovation at salesforce
Add to that, the C-level title is a great way to recruit talent in an escalating war for the best sellers. The Great Resignation is a real thing, and rewarding go-to-market vice presidents (VPs) with an expanded role is a great way to get people in the door and keep them there.
“The CRO title gives the person coming into the role the reassurance and confidence that they will lead all aspects of the team, and that someone else won’t be hired on top of them,” O’Neil said. “It lets you know that you’re at the highest level.”

Will chief revenue officers replace the head of sales?
So will CROs be coming for heads of sales’ jobs? Will heads of sales go the way of switchboard operators and become extinct? Not exactly.
“The VP of sales could still have a place in the revenue ecosystem. If we think of the CRO as being responsible for the entire go-to-market team and not just sales, it would make sense that your VP-level people from sales, marketing, and customer success would roll up to this CRO, who’s driving this overall strategy,” Corbett said.
Sometimes the way heads of sales might be incentivized — quarterly sprints — can run counter to what’s best for the long-term health of the company. The CRO helps to maintain a marathon mindset without getting distracted by quick wins.
“The head of sales, their life is a hard life. They’ve got to make sure they’re on target for the quarter and then another quarter and another, so you might call their job more tactical,” Maoz said. “But companies need to think across three years, five years, 10 years, a generation. So they bring in a chief revenue officer. This individual is freed up from what I’ll call ‘short termism.’ They can really get the big picture.”
Another differentiator between the two: their perspectives around recurring revenue. Renewals and retention are a CRO’s bread and butter. After all, closing new deals doesn’t matter if those customers churn out a year later.
To put it plainly, heads of sales win games, while CROs build a championship legacy.
Stay ready so you don’t have to get ready. This saying isn’t just for athletes. A mix of traditional and new, chief revenue officers are really chief “readiness” officers who prime your organization for success at scale. By playing the long game, the CRO cements a seamless customer journey and a predictable future for sales organizations.

(Anyone remember the chief “listening” officer craze?) Or is it an indispensable miracle function that will superpower your business and propel your revenue to new heights?

Businesses are realizing that to stay agile, strategic, and most importantly, sustainable, they need a  who can fold marketing, sales, and customer success into one seamless revenue machine.“In the last seven or eight years, we’ve seen a real emphasis on the chief revenue officer,” said Michael Maoz, senior vice president of innovation strategy at Salesforce. “They’re able to pinpoint how organizations can strategically move themselves into a very successful future.”			Discover the latest insights for s on “Think Outside the Quota,” a new original series		Did you just get promoted to be a ?

The  leverages cross-functional knowledge to create a complete view of the customer lifecycle from bringing in new leads to closing deals to renewing customer contracts.“What we learned from recent research is that ‘growth’ has a different definition than it did 10 years ago,” said Karen Semone, vice president of innovation strategy at Salesforce. “Growth isn’t just describing the financial valuation of a business anymore. It’s a broader term, inclusive of growing talent, market share, brand relevance.

Although the tasks may vary day to day, they might look something like this:Establishing a go-to-market strategy and defining revenue goals/metricsRecruiting, retaining, and training the best talentDiving deep into data analysis with revenue, pipelines, and forecastsAcquiring and deploying the right sales tools for efficiency and effectivenessFostering senior-level client relationships and influencing deal structureIncorporating customer feedback into the product development cycleHaving one person who’s accountable for alignment among all the revenue-related departments pays off. According to Forrester, companies that aligned people, processes, and technology across their sales and marketing teams achieved 36% more revenue growth and up to 28% more profitability.“The  is thinking way ahead. They’re thinking about renewals, and how to ensure that revenue continues to exist and persist beyond this quarter.

Silos evaporated as sales, marketing, and customer success had to come together as one to make decisions that would ensure survival.“We’re seeing this  role now because we’re starting to think about revenue as more of a continuum rather than just sales bringing in revenue,” said Asia Corbett, head of revenue and community operations at RevGenuis, a network for revenue professionals. “You need somebody at the top who is looking at the strategy over the whole buyer’s journey and not just focused on sales.”Companies need to think across three years, five years, 10 years, a generation. So they bring in a chief revenue officer.Michael Maoz, senior vp of Innovation at salesforceAdd to that, the C-level title is a great way to recruit talent in an escalating war for the best sellers. The Great Resignation is a real thing, and rewarding go-to-market vice presidents (s) with an expanded role is a great way to get people in the door and keep them there.“The  title gives the person coming into the role the reassurance and confidence that they will lead all aspects of the team, and that someone else won’t be hired on top of them,” O’Neil said. “It lets you know that you’re at the highest level.”			Get a 360 view of your revenue with Sales Cloud		Data syncing  and -power makes each quarter more predictable.learn moreWill chief revenue officers replace the head of sales?So will s be coming for heads of sales’ jobs?

The  helps to maintain a marathon mindset without getting distracted by quick wins.“The head of sales, their life is a hard life. They’ve got to make sure they’re on target for the quarter and then another quarter and another, so you might call their job more tactical,” Maoz said. “But companies need to think across three years, five years, 10 years, a generation. So they bring in a chief revenue officer. This individual is freed up from what I’ll call ‘short termism.’ They can really get the big picture.”Another differentiator between the two: their perspectives around recurring revenue.

                What is Customer Contact Management? 
            
            
            
            
        




Customer contact management, otherwise known as customer relationship management (CRM), refers to a system of collecting, storing, and organizing customer information.
Beyond that, customer contact management can become a system of following up with prospects, nurturing leads, tracking conversations, and even forecasting customer behavior. Having this data on-hand helps you close more deals and increase profits.

                What is Customer Contact Management? 
            
            
            
            
        




Customer contact management, otherwise known as customer relationship management (CRM), refers to a system of collecting, storing, and organizing customer information.
Beyond that, customer contact management can become a system of following up with prospects, nurturing leads, tracking conversations, and even forecasting customer behavior. Having this data on-hand helps you close more deals and increase profits.

                Territory Management 
            
            
            
            
        



Model your sales territories into a logical and flexible structure that maps the right sales reps to the right customers to maximize revenue.










 
    





 
    




            
                Drive performance with territory modeling. 
            
            
            
            
        



Copy a territory model so you can safely explore alternative modeling options. Use the new model to see what will perform best: new hierarchies, assignment rules, or territory assignments.





            
                Define an assignment rule once, use it in multiple territories. 
            
            
            
            
        



Assign a single rule to multiple territories. If you start from a territory record, you can also apply the rule to the territory’s descendants.





            
                Run territory rules directly from the territory hierarchy. 
            
            
            
            
        



A Run Rules option for each territory in the hierarchy means you can run rules for individual territories without leaving the context of the hierarchy.





            
                Identify territory users by territory role. 
            
            
            
            
        



Territory roles can help assigned users identify colleagues, collaborators, and other key resources to help close deals. Territory users can even have different roles in different territories.





























            
                Take an interactive guided tour.

                    What is Sales Cloud?
                





Sales Cloud is a cloud-based application designed to help your salespeople sell smarter and faster by centralizing customer information, logging their interactions with your company, and automating many of the tasks salespeople do every day. This means they’ll spend less time on administration and more time closing deals. For sales managers, Sales Cloud gives real-time visibility into their team’s activities, so forecasting sales with confidence is easy. Best of all, Sales Cloud is easy to use and customizable to the way your salespeople work. 








              
                Get a quick peek at the world's #1 CRM solution
              













                    How can Sales Cloud help my business grow?
                





Close more deals — Sales Cloud helps you keep track of all your customer information and interactions in a single place that’s accessible from anywhere, any time. Always have the most up-to-date contact information, find experts inside your organization to quickly answer customer questions, and see all relevant customer activities to move deals forward.

Get more leads — Not everyone who visits a site or responds to an email is a lead. Sales Cloud helps nurture those potential customers along until they’re a quality lead who’s ready to buy, then it automatically routes them to the right reps at the right time. 

Accelerate productivity — Sales Cloud lets you do more, from anywhere. Log calls, respond to hot leads, work opportunities, and check dashboards no matter where you are. Drive even more productivity by automating complex business processes.

Make insightful decisions — Sales Cloud dashboards give salespeople a real-time picture of the business at a glance. Detailed customer activity reports help you track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, determine business priorities, and make smart decisions based on the most up-to-date information. 















                    Is my business too small to use Sales Cloud?
                





	Sales Cloud is a cloud-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, so the software scales easily to accommodate every business size, from sole proprietorships to global enterprises. The benefits and advantages of Sales Cloud (see above) apply equally to all businesses regardless of size.















                    Does Sales Cloud work on my mobile device?
                





	Yes. Salesforce is supported on a variety of mobile platforms, including Android (v4.2+) and iOS (v8.0+). Additionally, the mobile browser app is accessible to many more devices, such as Blackberry (OS10.2+) and others through a web browser with internet connection. For a complete list of compatible mobile phones, tablets, and other devices, click here.















                    What is the difference between Sales Cloud and Service Cloud?
                





Sales Cloud is designed to help salespeople sell smarter and faster, allowing them to easily manage the company’s contacts, accounts, leads, opportunities, quotes, and deals all in one place. Service Cloud, on the other hand, helps companies run and improve their customer service using accounts, contacts, cases, and solutions. It’s designed to help support past, current, and future customer service requests to help companies retain their existing customers. The decision of which you need depends on which area of your business you’re trying to improve.

                    How secure is my data in Sales Cloud?
                





	Sales Cloud is built on a robust and flexible security architecture trusted by companies around the world, including those in the most heavily regulated industries — from financial services, to healthcare, to government. Trusted by more than 150,000 companies across all industries and around the world, the platform provides security and control over everything from user and client authentication through administrative permissions to the data access and sharing model.

Org Security — Salesforce protects your organization’s data from all other customer data by using a unique identifier that restricts access to your data at every level from anyone outside of your company — including us. 

User Security — User authentication (both delegated and SAML) combined with network-level security by IP address, session restrictions, and audit trails provides control and visibility into what users are doing in the system and their field history.

Programmatic Security — Configurable authenticated sessions secure access to logic, data, and metadata. Salesforce even offers a source code scanner that produces a report analyzing the security of your code.

Trust and Visibility — Trust starts with transparency, so Salesforce displays real-time information on system performance and security, and offers tips on best security practices for your organization. Learn more at trust.salesforce.com.

                Lightning Experience for Sales Cloud 
            
            
            
            
        








                    What is Lightning Experience?
                





Lightning Experience for Sales Cloud is a whole new user experience that helps salespeople sell smarter, faster, and the way they want. Lightning doesn’t have a tab interface like Aloha does; instead, information is surfaced as needed, so you get it when you need it. Lightning also has a new home page with an Account Insights feature that surfaces any news relevant to your accounts and opportunities, as well as an Assistant feature that prompts your next steps to keep things moving forward. Of course, for users who love the original look and feel, Sales Cloud Classic will still be available.










                    How do I start using Lightning Experience?
                





Once your Salesforce account is activated, you can start using Lightning Experience at any time by clicking your name in the upper-right corner of your account and selecting “Switch to Lightning Experience.” Once in Lightning Experience, you can easily return to Salesforce Classic by clicking your profile picture (again in the upper-right corner) and selecting “Switch to Salesforce Classic.” Salesforce Admins are able to configure, enable, or disable access to Lightning Experience for the entire organization or for a subset of users.










                    Can I still use Salesforce Classic?
                





Yes. You can continue using Salesforce Classic, and you can easily switch back to Salesforce Classic from Lightning Experience. We will continue to provide support for Salesforce Classic for the foreseeable future.

                    How do I get started implementing Sales Cloud?
                





You don’t have to be a Salesforce expert to get started — there are a number of helpful guides like Trailhead to get you up to speed fast. You can modify Sales Cloud as needed to best mirror how your company does business, and you’ll add new features as you grow, so that your information system is always the right size for your business. Here’s a helpful guide designed to help Salesforce administrators set up and customize a new sales organization.

                    How long is the Sales Cloud setup process?
                





The time it takes to configure Sales Cloud differs depending on your use case, yet compared to the time it takes to install, maintain, and upgrade software on individual machines across an entire organization, setup is a breeze. And for less complicated Sales Cloud configurations, you can be up and running in a matter of minutes.

Can I still use Salesforce Classic?                Yes. You can continue using Salesforce Classic, and you can easily switch back to Salesforce Classic from Lightning Experience. We will continue to provide support for Salesforce Classic for the foreseeable future.

Businesses demand fast, flexible, and secure ways to manage online payments. Looking beyond a checkout point solution, they now expect an ecommerce partner that can offer solutions to help them seamlessly run their business from anywhere. PayPal, the world’s leading online payments platform, is on a journey to transform how it delivers those solutions to its 392 million business and consumer account holders.
Over the past several years, PayPal has focused on advancing its product innovation and strategic partnerships to better serve its customers. With its rapid growth and numerous acquisitions came the need to unite several separate CRM systems, teams, and processes. PayPal sought to improve visibility and quality of data across departments so they could win more customers by getting to know their needs and concerns.
Dan Torunian, Vice President, Employee Technology & Experiences, recognized that, to elevate customer experience and grow the company’s customer base, PayPal would have to connect technology and people more effectively.
Let’s take a look at how Dan and his team are using Salesforce Customer 360 to do exactly that, helping them reach their goal of engaging 1 billion customers by uniting teams and company data with a single customer view. We’ve translated their learnings into actionable steps you can take to unite your company around your customers, too.

Previously, if PayPal merchants were interested in an additional PayPal product, they had to speak to a different representative for each product. With each new conversation, PayPal team members entered details in separate systems, preventing them from getting a clear picture of the customer’s overall history or product use with the company.
To streamline this experience, PayPal unified sales, service, and customer success teams to work together with a 360-degree view of all the customers’ interactions with the company, so teams can show up as one company, not a patchwork of separate entities. Team members are armed with the right information to recommend a solution, fit for every business need, making it easier to support and engage customers with context and relevance.
“Having a single source of truth allows our employees, to have the knowledge and data [they need] at their fingertips,” said Dan Torunian, Vice President, Employee Technology & Experiences and Data Centers.

To meet its company growth goals, PayPal needed to better scale its sales operations. operations. As a highly acquisitive company, PayPal Holdings has many sales teams, each with its own system and process. The company needed a better way to plan, forecast, and share data between teams and sell across product categories.
PayPal started by bringing all its sales teams under one umbrella and consolidating its data from four systems into a single sales CRM. Sales reps could leverage automation, scoring, and analytics to make it easier for team members to access information and confidently sell across the company’s entire portfolio.

“One of our biggest priorities is to remove the subjectivity from the sales cycle,” Torunian said.
Key performance indicators (KPIs) were built right in the CRM foundation to remove subjectivity from the sales cycle, enabling sellers to forecast more accurately and align territory and accounts among their teams.
With practical and visual insights embedded into the workflow, team members can more easily understand customers and make better decisions, including what solutions to recommend or sell next.
PayPal also reimagined how its sales teams access relevant information, templatizing sales and service best practices, and important account planning information, into a single collaboration tool. Now, PayPal’s teams can communicate more easily from anywhere, and gain greater visibility over the work being done on an account.

                3. Automate the sales cycle to speed up revenue growth. 
            
            
            
            
        



By leveraging automation, scoring, and analytics across its entire sales cycle, PayPal has freed up time for team members to focus on selling and closing deals faster. Automation shortened sales cycles and simplified quoting processes, allowing the company to realize revenue sooner.
“One of the biggest challenges when we were engaging with customers was to line up all the things we needed to organize internally,” said Frank Keller, PayPal’s Senior Vice President, Consumer In-Store and Digital Commerce. “It often took a long time to get an offer out or adjust it when negotiating with a customer. Now, through automation and greater predictability, we’re able to close deals much quicker than before.”
Having a single view of the customer gives sales team members the information and insights they need to not only act as a trusted advisor but create personalized experiences at every buying touchpoint. It also helps team members to upsell and cross-sell more effectively.
Consolidated technology also gives leadership the tools needed for more accurate forecasting, allowing them to make better business decisions and continually improve sales processes.

                4. Become trusted advisors with connected service.  
            
            
            
            
        



By aligning its sales and services teams more closely, PayPal is able to ensure its employees present as one team to customers across all touchpoints and channels. For example, being able to see details of a customer’s previous interactions with the company enables it to deliver effortless customer experiences.
PayPal is also working to transform its customer service to improve first-call resolution and customer satisfaction scores, while also reducing customer churn. With a single dashboard to review current information, automated tasks, and intelligent guided workflows, service agents have the tools they need to act as trusted advisors, create more meaningful customer interactions and build long-term loyalty.
“Service Cloud will help us significantly improve our ability to meet the customer with empathy at scale,” said Guru Bhat, PayPal’s Vice President, Omni-Channel, and Customer Success Platform. “This efficiency and understanding translates into better customer perceptions of our service and higher scores.”

                5. Enhance security by streamlining data integration. 
            
            
            
            
        



The experience that third parties have with PayPal is as important as the one that customers have. PayPal has made it simpler for third parties and partners to use its products by replacing its legacy integration setup with a modern API infrastructure. Fully compatible with the company’s technology stack, this infrastructure unlocks and allows data from different sources to talk to each other seamlessly and deliver critical projects faster.
“PayPal has so many different systems and capabilities,” said Torunian. “MuleSoft links them together like a railroad or freeway to communicate with each other in a seamless, effective, and secure way.”

                6. Prepare for the unexpected with strong foundations. 
            
            
            
            
        



Having united its business units around customers prior to COVID-19, PayPal had the strong foundations it needed to stay customer-focused when the pandemic hit. 
PayPal could better determine which solutions were best for merchants’ rising ecommerce needs — especially those that moved to an ecommerce-first model to continue business. 
Sales leaders could quickly redeploy sales reps to serve fitness companies that needed to upgrade their web-based payments experiences, for example, as they began offering virtual classes. 
PayPal’s strong digital backbone also enabled the company to continue accelerating when it mattered most, quickly adapting its go-to-market offerings and maintaining predictable revenue.

Businesses demand fast, flexible, and secure ways to manage online payments. Looking beyond a checkout point solution, they now expect an ecommerce partner that can offer solutions to help them seamlessly run their business from anywhere. PayPal, the world’s leading online payments platform, is on a journey to transform how it delivers those solutions to its 392 million business and consumer account holders.Over the past several years, PayPal has focused on advancing its product innovation and strategic partnerships to better serve its customers. With its rapid growth and numerous acquisitions came the need to unite several separate  systems, teams, and processes. PayPal sought to improve visibility and quality of data across departments so they could win more customers by getting to know their needs and concerns.Dan Torunian, Vice President, Employee Technology & Experiences, recognized that, to elevate customer experience and grow the company’s customer base, PayPal would have to connect technology and people more effectively.Let’s take a look at how Dan and his team are using Salesforce Customer 360 to do exactly that, helping them reach their goal of engaging 1 billion customers by uniting teams and company data with a single customer view. We’ve translated their learnings into actionable steps you can take to unite your company around your customers, too.                                 Related Content                                                         5 Sales Strategies to Fuel Recovery and Revenue Growth                            Guide                                                                                     5 Sales Strategies to Fuel Recovery and Revenue Growth                                                         5 Sales Strategies to Fuel Recovery and Revenue GrowthThe Transformation Playbook                            Guide                                                                                     The Customer 360 Playbook                                                         The Transformation PlaybookHow to Speed Up Revenue with Subscription and Usage Models                            Guide                                                                                     How to Speed Up Revenue with Subscription and Usage Models                                                         How to Speed Up Revenue with Subscription and Usage Models                                      “Having a single source of truth allows our employees, regardless of the function they perform, to have the knowledge and data they need at their fingertips.”                                                                                     Dan Torunian                                                         Vice President, Employee Technology & Experiences                             “Having a single source of truth allows our employees to have the knowledge and data they need at their fingertips.”                                                                                     Dan Torunian                                                         Vice President, Employee Technology & Experiences                                       Table of Contents                                                         Step 1.

Previously, if PayPal merchants were interested in an additional PayPal product, they had to speak to a different representative for each product.

                T-Mobile listens to customers and gives them exactly what they want. 
            
            
            
            
        



“#DeATThStar just doing what it normally does — NOT putting their customers first!” — @JohnLegere, September 2016
In response to a complaint about a competing mobile carrier, T-Mobile CEO John Legere didn’t mince words. His tweet is emblematic of the cheeky, take-no-prisoners attitude that has served Legere in remaking T-Mobile as the mobile industry’s customer-obsessed Un-carrier. The company is upending standard business practices with a wonderfully disruptive mandate: Listen to customers and give them exactly what they want.



 
    




            
                T-Mobile is a Trailblazer in the customer-obsessed revolution. 
            
            
            
            
        



	To that end, T-Mobile has thrown out service contracts, roaming fees, and data limits. Since 2016, the Un-carrier has offered unlimited 4G LTE data for every plan. And, in its latest Un-carrier move, T-Mobile introduced the T-Mobile Team of Experts, eliminating robots and automated phone menus. When customers call in for help, they will speak with real people from a tight-knit team dedicated to them and others in their city.

	Because Team of Experts is such a win for customers, employees, and shareholders, T-Mobile also announced that it’ll share the Team of Expert blueprints to help other companies adopt the revolutionary care model. That includes licensing several patent-pending technologies for free to anyone who commits to Team of Experts for all their customers — because every customer of every product or service deserves to be treated like a rock star.










 
    





















 
    












 
    




            
                T-Mobile is #1 in “customer satisfaction” and “likelihood to recommend,” according to Nielsen Mobile Insights data released in August 2016.

                The people are loving the revolution. 
            
            
            
            
        



This customer-obsessed approach is working. T-Mobile now serves 76 million people — more than twice as many as when Legere took over in 2012. The company stock price has more than quadrupled since going public in 2013, and the company has moved up from last place among the big four, overtaking Sprint. But perhaps most importantly, for the second year in a row, J.D. Power rated T-Mobile for Business #1 in wireless customer satisfaction all business sizes.
While Legere remakes the public face of the company, another more technical transformation is underway.





            
                Salesforce helps T-Mobile put the customer first. 
            
            
            
            
        



In 2008, T-Mobile’s B2B division, T-Mobile for Business, was already using Salesforce for its basic CRM functionality. But when business customers started sales conversations in retail stores, there was no way to pick up with customers if they then decided to buy outside the store. T-Mobile couldn’t capture information from millions of potential buyers and move it across channels, which would save customers time. Reps were also limited in their opportunities for follow-up.
T-Mobile has now streamlined the retail sales process with the help of a custom app. Retail reps use Salesforce to capture leads and manage appointments, while easily handing off data and orders to the company’s existing back-end infrastructure. Service Cloud routes web requests from T-Mobile for Business to the customer support team, and the sales team uses Sales Cloud to manage the pipeline.
































 
    







            
                Customers love the T-Mobile experience. 
            
            
            
            
        



Today, millions of businesses have joined T-Mobile for Business. Customers of T-Mobile for Business now get better customer service and faster responses, thanks to better, more complete tools for information capture.
T-Mobile sales staff, meanwhile, has more time for customers. With the Salesforce app in place, reps can place orders in minutes, resulting in a 70% reduction in work effort.





            
                T-Mobile expands integration to all customers. 
            
            
            
            
        



T-Mobile is still training T-Mobile for Business representatives with the new app. Once it has been completely deployed, leaders plan to expand the app’s usage to the consumer business where they'll be able to share leads between their telesales teams, in-store retail associates, and online shopping sites.
As T-Mobile rapidly achieves new heights of customer satisfaction, not just in mobile but across all industries, Legere’s tongue-in-cheek September 15 tweet — “Everyone should switch to @T-MobileBusiness. #Justsayin” — is proving to be true.

His tweet is emblematic of the cheeky, take-no-prisoners attitude that has served Legere in remaking T-Mobile as the mobile industry’s customer-obsessed Un-carrier. The company is upending standard business practices with a wonderfully disruptive mandate: Listen to customers and give them exactly what they want.                                 T-Mobile is a Trailblazer in the customer-obsessed revolution.                                                         	To that end, T-Mobile has thrown out service contracts, roaming fees, and data limits. Since 2016, the Un-carrier has offered unlimited 4G  data for every plan. And, in its latest Un-carrier move, T-Mobile introduced the T-Mobile Team of Experts, eliminating robots and automated phone menus. When customers call in for help, they will speak with real people from a tight-knit team dedicated to them and others in their city.                                 Learn how T-Mobile climbed to the top of customer satisfaction surveys using Service Cloud.                                                                                       Watch Demo                                        	Because Team of Experts is such a win for customers, employees, and shareholders, T-Mobile also announced that it’ll share the Team of Expert blueprints to help other companies adopt the revolutionary care model. That includes licensing several patent-pending technologies for free to anyone who commits to Team of Experts for all their customers — because every customer of every product or service deserves to be treated like a rock star.                                           T-Mobile is #1 in “customer satisfaction” and “likelihood to recommend,” according to Nielsen Mobile Insights data released in August 2016.                                                              Discover Trailhead. The fun way to learn Salesforce.                              Start Learning                                                                    The people are loving the revolution.                                                         This customer-obsessed approach is working. T-Mobile now serves 76 million people — more than twice as many as when Legere took over in 2012. The company stock price has more than quadrupled since going public in 2013, and the company has moved up from last place among the big four, overtaking Sprint. But perhaps most importantly, for the second year in a row, J.D. Power rated T-Mobile for Business #1 in wireless customer satisfaction all business sizes.While Legere remakes the public face of the company, another more technical transformation is underway.                            Salesforce helps T-Mobile put the customer first.                                                         In 2008, T-Mobile’s B2B division, T-Mobile for Business, was already using Salesforce for its basic  functionality. But when business customers started sales conversations in retail stores, there was no way to pick up with customers if they then decided to buy outside the store. T-Mobile couldn’t capture information from millions of potential buyers and move it across channels, which would save customers time. Reps were also limited in their opportunities for follow-up.T-Mobile has now streamlined the retail sales process with the help of a custom app. Retail reps use Salesforce to capture leads and manage appointments, while easily handing off data and orders to the company’s existing back-end infrastructure. Service Cloud routes web requests from T-Mobile for Business to the customer support team, and the sales team uses Sales Cloud to manage the pipeline.                                 Customers love the T-Mobile experience.                                                         Today, millions of businesses have joined T-Mobile for Business. Customers of T-Mobile for Business now get better customer service and faster responses, thanks to better, more complete tools for information capture.T-Mobile sales staff, meanwhile, has more time for customers. With the Salesforce app in place, reps can place orders in minutes, resulting in a 70% reduction in work effort.                            T-Mobile expands integration to all customers.                                                         T-Mobile is still training T-Mobile for Business representatives with the new app. Once it has been completely deployed, leaders plan to expand the app’s usage to the consumer business where they'll be able to share leads between their telesales teams, in-store retail associates, and online shopping sites.As T-Mobile rapidly achieves new heights of customer satisfaction, not just in mobile but across all industries, Legere’s tongue-in-cheek September 15 tweet — “Everyone should switch to @T-MobileBusiness. #Justsayin” — is proving to be true.                                 Keep exploring stories like this one.                                                                                      sends customer satisfaction through the roof with Salesforce                                                         	Find out how the Dutch telecom is smashing targets, boosting customer satisfaction and empowering employees to be the best they can with new digital strategy.

                Surf Air disrupts the airline industry with some help from Salesforce. 
            
            
            
            
        



Surf Air has been called “a disruptor of tomorrow” by Fast Company, and “the future of flying” by Forbes, but when it comes to winning customers over, this startup has reached the stratosphere. Launched in 2013 as the first ever all-you-can-fly airline, Surf Air’s members fly up and down the California coast with ease for one monthly subscription fee. “Time is the new commodity,” explained Justin Hart, vice president of member acquisition. Surf Air saves members time by cutting back on the pain associated with air travel. Members book flights from their smartphones in less than a minute, arrive at the airport as little as fifteen minutes before departure time, skip traditional security lines, and enjoy friendly concierges who greet them in the terminal to handle baggage check and other details. “Ultimately at the end of the day, we’re giving our members their time back,” said Jeff Potter, president and CEO. Surf Air’s flight plan has grown to 2,300 members with no signs of slowing down. The startup is expanding its fleet of planes from 11 to 65 by 2021, and has begun to add weekend leisure trips to its schedule of business-oriented weekday flights. Which is why Surf Air turned to Salesforce. “Our airline is built around our customers’ needs,” said Hart. “Salesforce helps us keep track of all of our relationships and manage our guest list.” Using the world’s #1 CRM system, reps are able to set up test flights for prospects so they can experience the ease of flying Surf Air firsthand. Then they follow up with customized emails sent directly from Salesforce. Often referred to as the “Uber of the skies,” Surf Air also uses Salesforce to find the right audience in the specific geographic markets it serves, tracking flight preferences once members join. This level of personalized service leads to both winning, and keeping, loyal customers.

                A membership club that happens to fly airplanes 
            
            
            
            
        



Customer happiness is paramount to Surf Air’s mission. The company wins customer love with an innovative offering backed by outstanding service. “We are a membership club that happens to fly airplanes,” Potter explained. Passengers on Surf Air flights enjoy BMW-designed leather seats, plenty of legroom, and free Wi-Fi. But they also enjoy something possibly even more rare and valuable than personal space on a plane: a sense of community among its members. “What we’re providing is the interaction you get on the airplane,” Potter said. “At the end of last year, 11% of our members had begun a business deal with other members on the plane. Flying Surf Air is unlike flying traditional economy or even business class.” Potter and Hart said they won’t grow the business without protecting that community feel. To wit, more than half of Surf Air’s new members come from member referrals, and the company has started hosting member nights that are more like networking mixers than hard-sell opportunities. “There are no sales happening at these events — the members get to engage with each other and with us,” Potter said. Salesforce helps Surf Air’s membership teams manage relationships with current and prospective members with the right mix of automation and personal touch. Pardot lets the company deliver different campaigns and interactions to prospects based on their histories. A new visitor to Surf Air’s website would, for example, have a different experience than a referral who’d just completed a buddy flight. Surf Air’s custom Salesforce workflow also leverages Pardot automation to keep customer information and important tasks top of mind, while still allowing plenty of room for personalized, premium member service. That workflow also includes using Data.com to find new prospects in targeted areas along the West Coast, and then creating and nurturing new leads in Pardot to qualify and hand off to sales teams via Sales Cloud. And third-party AppExchange solutions like DocuSign make it easy to build new functionality into the platform as the company’s needs evolve. “What’s great is that I built that workflow,” Hart said. “I didn’t have to go out to a tech developer to have them build that. That flow is all there — anyone on my team could have built that.” Potter and Hart like to tell stories of how Surf Air has changed its members’ lives. There’s the executive who finally made it to his son’s science fair thanks to the San Diego to San Francisco route. There’s the client who added his daughter to his membership so she could fly home from college to see him. And there’s the member who chartered a flight so he could marry his bride on a Surf Air plane. These tales abound, and they all carry the same message: Surf Air is changing lives by changing the way people fly. “Our customers love us,” said Hart. “And Salesforce is an important part of that.”

","See how Surf Air disrupted the private airline industry in more ways than one. - Salesforce.comSkip to content                                    A                                                          “Our members and prospects love us. And Salesforce is an important part of that.”         ,                                                                                                                                         Related Stories                                                         Happy employees equal happy customers For Southwest AirlinesPenske Logistics moves to Lightning rapidly with help from Success Cloud. handles record daily volumes of support cases with Salesforce.                              see all stories                                          Surf Air disrupts the airline industry with some help from Salesforce.                                                         Surf Air has been called “a disruptor of tomorrow” by Fast Company, and “the future of flying” by Forbes, but when it comes to winning customers over, this startup has reached the stratosphere. Launched in 2013 as the first ever all-you-can-fly airline, Surf Air’s members fly up and down the California coast with ease for one monthly subscription fee. “Time is the new commodity,” explained Justin Hart, vice president of member acquisition. Surf Air saves members time by cutting back on the pain associated with air travel. Members book flights from their smartphones in less than a minute, arrive at the airport as little as fifteen minutes before departure time, skip traditional security lines, and enjoy friendly concierges who greet them in the terminal to handle baggage check and other details. “Ultimately at the end of the day, we’re giving our members their time back,” said Jeff Potter, president and . Surf Air’s flight plan has grown to 2,300 members with no signs of slowing down. The startup is expanding its fleet of planes from 11 to 65 by 2021, and has begun to add weekend leisure trips to its schedule of business-oriented weekday flights. Which is why Surf Air turned to Salesforce. “Our airline is built around our customers’ needs,” said Hart. “Salesforce helps us keep track of all of our relationships and manage our guest list.” Using the world’s #1  system, reps are able to set up test flights for prospects so they can experience the ease of flying Surf Air firsthand. Then they follow up with customized emails sent directly from Salesforce. Often referred to as the “Uber of the skies,” Surf Air also uses Salesforce to find the right audience in the specific geographic markets it serves, tracking flight preferences once members join. This level of personalized service leads to both winning, and keeping, loyal customers.     “Our airline is built around our customers’ needs. Salesforce helps us keep track of all of our relationships and manage our guest list.”         ,                                                       A membership club that happens to fly airplanes                                                         Customer happiness is paramount to Surf Air’s mission. The company wins customer love with an innovative offering backed by outstanding service. “We are a membership club that happens to fly airplanes,” Potter explained. Passengers on Surf Air flights enjoy -designed leather seats, plenty of legroom, and free Wi-Fi. But they also enjoy something possibly even more rare and valuable than personal space on a plane: a sense of community among its members. “What we’re providing is the interaction you get on the airplane,” Potter said. “At the end of last year, 11% of our members had begun a business deal with other members on the plane. Flying Surf Air is unlike flying traditional economy or even business class.” Potter and Hart said they won’t grow the business without protecting that community feel. To wit, more than half of Surf Air’s new members come from member referrals, and the company has started hosting member nights that are more like networking mixers than hard-sell opportunities. “There are no sales happening at these events — the members get to engage with each other and with us,” Potter said. Salesforce helps Surf Air’s membership teams manage relationships with current and prospective members with the right mix of automation and personal touch. Pardot lets the company deliver different campaigns and interactions to prospects based on their histories. A new visitor to Surf Air’s website would, for example, have a different experience than a referral who’d just completed a buddy flight. Surf Air’s custom Salesforce workflow also leverages Pardot automation to keep customer information and important tasks top of mind, while still allowing plenty of room for personalized, premium member service. That workflow also includes using Data.com to find new prospects in targeted areas along the West Coast, and then creating and nurturing new leads in Pardot to qualify and hand off to sales teams via Sales Cloud.

“With Salesforce, we're able to do things today that we could only dream of a few years ago.”

        CHRIS DAWSON, VP & GENERAL MANAGER AT BRP

                The innovative spirit of BRP reinvents the powersports experience 
            
            
            
            
        



BRP is a world leader in manufacturing powersports vehicles, including Ski-Doo and Lynx snowmobiles, Sea-Doo watercraft, Can-Am Spyder and off-road vehicles, Evinrude outboard engines, and Rotax engines. It all started in 1942 in Valcourt, Quebec, Canada, by Joseph-Armand Bombardier who wanted to invent a better way to travel on snow, which led to the early design patterns of the Ski-Doo snowmobile. That innovative spirit is at the core of everything at BRP. They have taken that same innovative approach to launch a visionary strategy that goes beyond their innovative products to connect with their consumers. To achieve this vision, BRP deployed Sales Cloud and Service Cloud portals to their 4,200 dealers worldwide. Creating an interconnected web of dealers who are plugged into the manufacturer, each other, and focused on delighting the consumer around key moments of truth. Often the first engagement a consumer has with the BRP brand is online. Consumers who build custom vehicles and request quotes online are automatically routed to the closest dealer through lead management in the dealer portal. Dealers can respond quickly to customer questions, do some homework on the customer, get them into the dealership, and then tailor the ultimate test ride.



 
    








“The dealer portal lets dealers find much faster, much more effective ways of delivering on those key moments of truth for our end consumers.”

        CHRIS DAWSON, VP & GENERAL MANAGER AT BRP
        
        
    









	Another key moment in the consumer experience is when they need service. BRP deployed the Salesforce Service Cloud portal, connecting backoffice SAP data on vehicles and owners, so dealers and technicians can instantly look up vehicle information, warranty coverage, warranty claims, service history, and even have the built-in knowledgebase filter down articles for the specific vehicle. In addition, they deployed a community to connect the 4,200 dealers globally, who can now share years of knowledge and best practices. Finally, technicians and even customers can ask queries and log cases and be connected directly to engineering and support teams at BRP. Consumers not only want a personalized experience, they also value their recreational time, so there’s a huge focus on getting the vehicles back on the road -- or snow, dirt, or water -- as soon as possible. BRP never stops innovating. They are continuing their rich history of innovation and market leadership across their product categories and now they’re re-defining what they call the “Ultimate Powersports Experience.”

                Zero Motorcycles revs up performance with Salesforce 
            
            
            
            
        



Electric motorcycles are taking off and Zero Motorcycles is leading the pack with a combination of innovative products and state-of-the-art service. Hailed by Forbes as the “Tesla of motorcycles,” Zero has quickly become the industry leader in high-performance electric motorcycles that surpass traditional gas-powered bikes in almost every metric. “Few other motorcycle companies have made bigger strides in a shorter time than Zero,” Cycle World wrote in a recent review. But the road to the top hasn’t come without a few speed bumps. Despite their reputation for technological innovation — and a made-in-America pedigree — in one key area Zero was not firing on all cylinders: customer service, for both owners and dealers. “We knew we had a great product,” says Mike Cunningham, Director of U.S. Sales and Dealer Development. “But we also knew we weren’t delivering the optimum experience for our customers, our dealers, and even prospective buyers taking a first look at Zero. Salesforce helped us change all that.”



 
    








“Every year we’re looking to grow revenue by 100%. That’s why we need a platform that can grow with us.”

        Aaron Cheatham, Director of Customer Experience at Zero Motorcycles
        
        
    











            
                Innovative products deserve an innovative customer experience 
            
            
            
            
        



	For example, before Salesforce, Zero was using three disparate systems that dealers needed to negotiate – one for sales, one for service, and one for marketing. Dealers had to send in paper warranty cards to register new owners. The result? Zero employees would stand around the fax machine waiting for new paperwork to come through. “How can we be a high-tech company and not deliver a high-tech experience?” asks Aaron Cheatham, Director of Customer Experience at Zero. Zero was ready to take a new look at its entire business so they partnered with Salesforce Ignite, a customer-driven innovation program. “Every year we’re looking to grow revenue by 100%,” says Cheatham. “That’s why we need a platform that can grow with us, and we discovered that Salesforce could transform our entire business.” Through the Ignite program, Zero and Salesforce used a human-centered design approach to reimagine the rider and dealer experience. This resulted in a solution powered by Salesforce Customer 360 that delivered a high-touch customer experience surpassing anything available in the industry.





            
                High performance. High touch. 
            
            
            
            
        



	“We hope that everybody who buys our bike has a great experience with the product,” says Richard Walker, CEO. “But to be a world-class brand, everything else has to work, every other touchpoint the customer has with you has to be first class, and that is what Salesforce has enabled us to do.”

Today, a prospective customer enjoys a seamless experience from start to finish. It begins with Marketing Cloud, which Zero uses to generate targeted, relevant communications like the latest product news and releases, industry trends, and reviews of bikes. Zero sales managers can track the journey of a lead from the moment a rider clicks on an email to when they visit the website to the moment of truth – when they sign up for a demo.

“Once somebody drives one of our bikes, they’re sold,” says Cunningham. “So our #1 priority is to get them into the dealer to demo a bike.”





            
                Birth of the connected motorcycle 
            
            
            
            
        



	Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of Zero’s new approach is the way they integrated their products into this seamless customer experience by creating connected motorcycles. If an owner ever has a mechanical problem, he can tap the help button in the app and get service advice on the spot because Zero can access key data remotely, diagnose the issue, and schedule an appointment if necessary. The result has been 50% faster response for emergency service and 25% reduction in support tickets. And firmware updates – which are currently rolled out manually and require owners to bring their bikes into a dealer — will soon be pushed out to owners, allowing Zero to update every bike’s software remotely. Using Community Cloud, Zero built a dealer community that enhances communication among dealers, access to a common inventory, and a forum to solve issues that arise. This seamless communication system between owners, dealers, bikes, and manufacturer has virtually eliminated the lag time and miscommunication that hampered Zero in its early days. Salesforce Customer 360 has changed the entire ownership experience for any rider and created a new sense of engagement with the brand and the community. “Salesforce opened opportunities for us that we didn’t even know existed,” says Chris Heimbuck, Director of Marketing.

This seamless communication system between owners, dealers, bikes, and manufacturer has virtually eliminated the lag time and miscommunication that hampered Zero in its early days. Salesforce Customer 360 has changed the entire ownership experience for any rider and created a new sense of engagement with the brand and the community. “Salesforce opened opportunities for us that we didn’t even know existed,” says Chris Heimbuck, Director of Marketing.                                 Keep exploring stories like this one.

Hailed by Forbes as the “Tesla of motorcycles,” Zero has quickly become the industry leader in high-performance electric motorcycles that surpass traditional gas-powered bikes in almost every metric. Despite their reputation for technological innovation — and a made-in-America pedigree — in one key area Zero was not firing on all cylinders: customer service, for both owners and dealers. “But we also knew we weren’t delivering the optimum experience for our customers, our dealers, and even prospective buyers taking a first look at Zero. That’s why we need a platform that can grow with us.”        Aaron Cheatham, Director of Customer Experience at Zero Motorcycles                                                Innovative products deserve an innovative customer experience                                                         	For example, before Salesforce, Zero was using three disparate systems that dealers needed to negotiate – one for sales, one for service, and one for marketing. “How can we be a high-tech company and not deliver a high-tech experience?” asks Aaron Cheatham, Director of Customer Experience at Zero. Zero was ready to take a new look at its entire business so they partnered with Salesforce Ignite, a customer-driven innovation program. “Every year we’re looking to grow revenue by 100%,” says Cheatham. “That’s why we need a platform that can grow with us, and we discovered that Salesforce could transform our entire business.” Through the Ignite program, Zero and Salesforce used a human-centered design approach to reimagine the rider and dealer experience. “But to be a world-class brand, everything else has to work, every other touchpoint the customer has with you has to be first class, and that is what Salesforce has enabled us to do.”Today, a prospective customer enjoys a seamless experience from start to finish. It begins with Marketing Cloud, which Zero uses to generate targeted, relevant communications like the latest product news and releases, industry trends, and reviews of bikes. Zero sales managers can track the journey of a lead from the moment a rider clicks on an email to when they visit the website to the moment of truth – when they sign up for a demo.“Once somebody drives one of our bikes, they’re sold,” says Cunningham. “So our #1 priority is to get them into the dealer to demo a bike.”                            Birth of the connected motorcycle                                                         	Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of Zero’s new approach is the way they integrated their products into this seamless customer experience by creating connected motorcycles. And firmware updates – which are currently rolled out manually and require owners to bring their bikes into a dealer — will soon be pushed out to owners, allowing Zero to update every bike’s software remotely. “Salesforce opened opportunities for us that we didn’t even know existed,” says Chris Heimbuck, Director of Marketing.

Building customer relationships requires time, effort, and sincerity. Sysco, the world’s largest food distributor, keeps its customer-company philosophy front and center on its website — and in everything it does. The company, which sells to 400,000+ customers in the U.S., Canada, and Ireland uses Salesforce to keep employees connected and working together to help customers. “With Salesforce, we have a level of visibility to customers that we never had before,” said Wayne Shurts, CTO. “And we’re able to collaborate to help them much more effectively, which is key for our continued growth.”
Sysco sells to restaurants, hospitals, universities, nursing homes, schools, and companies that manage commercial dining. Its sales team of 8,500+ uses Salesforce to track opportunities and better manage relationships. Reps spend over 90% of their time on the road, so the ability to access customer information from their personal mobile devices is critical. A custom app — called Sysco360 — helps them discover cross-sell and upsell opportunities. “Salesforce is helping our entire business grow,” said Shurts. “In Houston alone, we’re up 14% year over year.”
Sysco is made up of 70+ operating companies, so making it easy to share data between individual entities is essential. The Salesforce Platform adds a layer of agility to the company’s SAP back end so reps can easily access data and reports while visiting customer sites or from the company’s 70+ warehouses.
Chatter is used companywide, so 45,000+ employees spread across the individual operating companies can access Salesforce records, share information, and trade best practices from their mobile devices. The ability to collaborate from anywhere helps bridge the geographical gap among operations in the U.S., Canada, and Ireland. “For the first time we can do team selling, and work together across geographies,” said Shurts. “And, Chatter creates a more social leadership dynamic. It creates an open dialogue across the entire organization that has really glued us together.”
Sysco also engages with customers on social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Marketing Cloud helps the company listen to conversations about its brand and communicate one-on-one with customers. “We can hear what customers say about us, and about our competitors,” said Shurts. “And if we hear about an issue, we can address it right away.”

                Sysco delivers more value for customers. 
            
            
            
            
        



	In the future, Sysco plans to build more apps on the Customer 360 Platform to help reps do more value-added selling while visiting clients. The company is planning a menu analysis app that will let reps use iPads to help clients discover new ingredients to create better products and margins, or learn how to optimize menu placement for high margin items. “Salesforce is helping us figure out more ways for our sales reps to help our customers,” said Shurts.
